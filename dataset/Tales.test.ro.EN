With her boundless love, shown to her aunt, and with her keen mind, this girl managed to save the man from certain death!
- If so, then tomorrow at eight o'clock we'll go there together.
He takes the bird to the crane - and honours the crane, and praises him everywhere. The vizier was dying of grief. "Don't hurry," he said to his son, "or you'll never get rid of me! I'll cook it for you, you'll see!" And then he slipped it to his wife:
The beauty of the world hearing the misfortune - that they have killed her man, takes the water-glass, sprinkles her man and resurrects him on the spot. Then she says to him:
He sat down on the porch and considered whether to go up, or not to go up at all. He took heart, and went in, for he was no coward.
- I sell, but on lies!
They see her, they rush at her, they slap her mouth, tie her hands behind her back and - to the mountain with her!
- Money! I want money!" he said again.
- Mom, don't I have a father? Only other kids do, buying them all kinds of goodies?
- Come home and get it!
The emperor, when he heard so - the sky fell on him. The bullet would have pierced him - and no blood would have flowed from him.
We left Baiasa a bit late and could not reach Avdela until night. There were three of us, and we were all in good spirits. My companions on the road knew the haiduci, the masters of the night, so I had no worries.
- We're listening!
- Come on, buddy, it smells like gunpowder around here! Let's wash up!
What about the nose? How much she was bruised, and - because of it - how many scandals, how many spats at the fountain, with the girls who - damn them, they called her... a nose like a furnace! In his youth - he had a fight with a neighbour and for forty years he didn't speak to her! Should she tell her, the impudent one, that under her nose, Cuscuta's nose that is - seven flocks of sheep could be sheltered?!
How the years go by and how the world gets worse!
It was getting dark. The stars flickered across the sky. Willing or not, Mitu's Tegă stayed at the fair. The shepherds set to work: one drew the lamb in the skewer and lit the fire, another got foliage, twigs from the forest, which he then used to prepare a hut and a bed, a soft bed, only made of green hay, for the guest... Then the three of them lay down by the fire, the fire had now subsided, the fire-pan was browning beautifully over the rich hearth, dripping with fat, and pouring out steam, what steam - full of scents! Through the trees, through their branches, the moon crept, and it seemed as if the forest grew and moved in the beat of its cold, silent rays, which filled the solitude with mystery. The shadows of the mountains stretched endlessly under the moon. A night bird fluttered its wings over them unseen.
HAIDA
In the Romanian villages of S. and M., a big wedding is held, starting eight days before the wedding and ending eight days after. The bachelor Bucuvală, marries his son, Chita, to the daughter of the bachelor Nastu, from M. In both villages, from the small to the big, they are happy that their bachelors are getting married. Only one soul, Nastu's Haida, the girl after whom she is to be a bride for seven days, is very sad and heartbroken with grief at the thought that one day she will be the wife of Bucuvală's Chita. She, the beautiful and proud Haidă, she - the only offspring of the renowned Nastu - to take an ugly, graceless and always sickly, like Chita, - better, death!
Fifteen years have passed since Haida's engagement. She was only two at the time and Chita was five. Nastu had sworn his daughter to Bucuvală's son, and they had remained cousins ever since. They raised their children, but as beautiful and wonderful as Haida was, Chita was ugly, suffering, weak in body and mind. But Bucuvală was a great one, his herds were many, as were caravans of mules as beautiful as angels. Chitu was not to be taken out into the world, but with so much wealth - he could live well with Haida. That's what Nastu and his wife thought - and it never crossed their minds that Haida wouldn't want Chita. Besides, what if he didn't want him - what could he do, would he dare to oppose them? Was it possible to ruin such an old encuscrement? The girl knew this, and when she thought of what lay ahead of her, she sighed and wept tears as big as plums. And now, when she saw that the time was drawing near to enter Cheita's house, from dawn till dusk she would still weep.
Her parents didn't understand why the girl was upset, because when they asked her - why are you crying? she answered that it was for them, that she would leave them alone, and again she was drowning in tears...
Nastu had a shepherd, Chendra, so handsome and handsome that you wanted to take his head and go with him. And this Chendra talked like he had honey in his mouth. She was very fond of him, and when she saw him, it was as if she saw the sun, and so - about nothing at all - for hours she would talk to him, often even scolding him when he was late coming down from the sheep, and when someone else came for bread, she would do what she did and give him too little, so that he would make Chendra come down to the village himself.
The week of the wedding, Chendra was in the village. He could see Haida with teary eyes, but it was not in his power to ask her why she was crying. On Thursday, when they had dressed her as a bride, Haida cried so much that when he saw her in the evening he could not stop: he approached her and in his sweet voice said:
- Forgive me, Haida, for speaking to you, but - please - tell me: what are you crying about all day?
- Alas, alas - Chendra, you, Chendra - if you were in my heart! Come a little closer, like this - let me tell you what trouble I'm in.
In the garden, under a cherry tree, the girl, her eyes brimming with tears, began to tell him:
- Don't you know, my boy, that my folks are marrying me, that next Sunday I'll be the wife of that ugly, cursed Cheetah? Look at me, you - who have known me for years: do I match Chita? Does it suit me to go out with him, to go out in the world with that rascal? Isn't it a pity of my pride, to close my life with one like him? I don't want his wealth, nor the fringe of his name, nor his house, - but I would love a man, - not to be ashamed of him when he takes me out into the world. Ah, Chendra brother, - did you really not notice how my heart would swell when I saw you come from the sheep, how I loved to talk with you, endlessly?
And, crying stops her talking. Chendra, poor thing, who would never have believed that a celnic girl, especially one like Haida, could think of him, even love him - had swallowed his words whole when he heard what he heard from Haida. He was silent too, and so was Haida, who was always crying. Finally, Haida said again:
- Listen, Chendra - two things escape me about Chita: you, or this... And that's when he pulled a knife out of his pocket. Either we both run away, far away - where no one around here will see us, and there we can live together as we please, or on Sunday, when I enter the church in Chita's village, so that no one will put the crown on my head - with this knife I'll escape the shame that people want to put on me.
- Well, Haida, but - you, a celestial girl, a beauty and a mind like no one's, how can you be with a shepherd, like me?
- Listen here, Chendra: you're a good, hardworking, handsome boy. As for my heart, and many a time I was ready to ask Daddy to give me up for you, but knowing his temper... That's why, Chendra, don't let me die by the knife. Tomorrow's Friday, Saturday the cousins are coming for me. In the evening we'll stop at the spring, up at our cabin. There, all the others will party, sing, play... I'll stake out the right moment, sneak away from the spits, you come after me and - both of us, run away, escape this evil world. What do you say?
Chendra, what to say, was taken aback, hearing these words, and, after some thought, said to the girl:
- Come on, baby, either I die with you or we run away together on Saturday night. Become a bride, Haido, and - God with us!
- God help us!" said the girl, and they parted. Haida is calmer, now she no longer cries, but - with a heart full of joy, she is a bride, like all brides...
Saturday arrived, and the many, many, many cousins came to pick up their bride. Come on, in a silk dress and a handkerchief to match, with a veil on her head, with a sprinkling of yellow up to her waist, you'd have thought she was a fairy. They put her on a horse and rode off to Cheita's village. There were so many people there, the like of which had never been seen at any other wedding. Chendra wore the bride's horse by the bridle, but if you looked closely, you could see that he was in deep thought.
In the evening they reached Nastu's stable and there ten shepherds were cutting and cleaning the noateni, while as many were setting the jars to put them on the spit. Five horses laden with barrels of wine were also stripped - but Nastu still said it wouldn't be enough. The feast began with brandy, and when the skewers were ready - fifteen shepherds were pouring wine to the worshippers - there still weren't enough. There was singing and hopping of the cubs, so that it seemed as if you were on some other world!
Time was running out, and when the wine was running low, few people were left awake. Haida pretended to be asleep, and when all around her had closed their eyes too, - as she was dressed, bride - she slipped lightly away from her cousins and then hurried down to the valley, where Chendra had descended. Both of them, - nights and days they went on and on, away, way for weeks.
The wedding is broken. Nastu and his family returned to the village. But the poor man was so ashamed - he grew old in just one day, as if countless years had passed over him. When he returned to the village, he commanded that the name of Haida should never be mentioned in his house again.
Twenty-five years have passed since then. It was a Saturday, around noon. Almost all the Romans of the village of M. had gone out into the orchard near their settlement, where the young men were caught up in the horde, and the old men were watching them from the sidelines, many of them feeling very sorry that their legs would not help them to hop about a little.
Three travellers could be seen in the sky, coming on horseback. They got up and stopped right next to the village elders. Leading them was a young man, proud and handsome as an angel. He had such dignity in his eyes that the elders rose to their feet when the boy, dismounting, bade them good day. The hour stopped too, and all the world had eyes only for the travellers. By their dress, they did not seem to be local people, almost. After a good meal, as is the Aromanian custom, one of the old men told the young traveller that there was no inn in the village, but if he wished to honour his house, he invited him to be his guest tonight. The young man ordered his companions to take his horses and, accompanied by a lad, they led them into the village. When the hour broke, towards evening, the traveller, with a company of men, went to the host who had invited him for a rest, where they stayed for a while.
In appearance, this young man looked like someone from the village - and many old men talked about it among themselves, but no one could quite make out who he looked like.
The next morning, in church, to honour the young man, they placed him next to the village leaders. And next to him sat Nastu, who never took his eyes off the young traveller during the service.
Since that black day, when Nastu suffered the shame of his life, that his wife ran away from him, many times - people from the village, as well as strangers, wanted to talk about Haida, but he stopped any discussion - who wants to be at my heart, he said - don't talk to me about it. Nastu himself never mentioned the girl in the house.
Now, the older man, the more he looked at the boy, the more he felt he wanted, from his heart, to talk to him.
Outside the church, people in the courtyard, in groups of five or six, were arranging their visits to be made, and further away, old Nastu, leaning on his staff, was still shooting at the young stranger out of the corner of his eye. When the old woman came out of the church, the stick called her to him, and after whispering a few words to her, she turned her eyes to the traveller. It seemed as if the old woman's heart was also taken away.
The world dispersed, and the two old men slowly left too.
When they got home, the old lady - as never before - didn't know how best to decorate her guest room. Her heart was full of joy and she even told her that something new, something good was going to happen in this house today. From time to time, he would go out to the gate to see if the stranger was coming towards them.
Around noon, indeed, a group of people, with the young traveller among them, came to visit old Nastu. The old woman's legs were trembling, and the old man's heart was beating so hard, it was as if it were beating out of his chest. There was talk of one thing and another, but Nastu wasn't paying any attention, he kept fretting how to get the stranger to ask where he was from. The young man helped him, because he started it himself, about that.
- You bastard, I noticed, even in church, that you look at me on purpose. Maybe you want to know who I am. I've come a long way. There's a great celibate living in our house. God has given him everything, but his wife has an unquenchable thirst: she's too far from her parents and hasn't seen them for a long time. Knowing that they are passing by, she asked me to bring you their good wishes - you and your wife, many good wishes. But why to you in particular and not to someone else here in the village, I don't know.
- Tell me, mother dear," said Maia Nastu, "isn't that woman called Haida? And is she related to you in some way?
- If I knew you were fond of that celiac and his wife, Haida, I'd tell you how I'm related to them.
- How can we not be fond of Haida, my son," the old woman rushed, "since she is our daughter?
- Then know that I am Haida's boy, and I come to hear it from you - if you have forgiven her....
The old woman couldn't help herself; she rushed to her nephew and started kissing him, she couldn't get enough. Poor old Nastu, you'd have thought he'd frozen where he sat. One of the guests took him by the arm and led him to his nephew, who kissed his hand, and the old man in turn kissed the boy on the forehead, while his eyes filled with tears.
At lunch and dinner, the grandson was the guest of old Nastu, and after another two months, the celnic Chendra with Haida, with all the household, with the flocks of sheep, the caravans of horses - they came to the village of M.
Old Nastu's house, which had been locked up for so many years, has opened up to the world again. Chendra and Haida, nice as they were in their youth, loved and honoured the old people beyond measure. They, who had never wanted to know anything in their long loneliness, were now no longer tired of life - and they lived for many more years, raising grandchildren and grandchildren's grandchildren.
GRANDDAUGHTER OF A SECURITY GUARD
The mountains were deserted.
The flocks of sheep came down to winter... the shepherds are nowhere to be seen... families - in caravans - have also left... The village, alone now, is bewailing its fate. The woods are rustling, as if they were confessing their longing for their friends who have gone far, far away, who brought with them the joys and hopes of the place.
The dear songs in the flute have gone silent, the proud aromatics are no longer heard humming. The sharp wind has taken their place, sweeping the leaves away and filling the whole village with them... The wind awakens the village as if from a heavy dream, and then moves on, whistling through the rocky valleys of the mountains.
How sad autumn descends here, how many of those who fall in love do not part... How many loves does it not make languish and even fade, forever!
The small, cold rain, which seemed as if it would never hold off, has now stood. Up through the cracks in the ragged clouds, the faint rays of sunlight crept, almost perished, as flocks and men and caravans trudged up the mountain slope.
The farmers were urging their horses on, knowing that beyond the bend lay the plateau where they would make a restful rest.
Through deep valleys - the sun doesn't penetrate at all. Shadows begin to lengthen over mountains and over meadows, first as a grey light, then as a black shroud... black, under which the forests disappear into silence. The plains, also plunged in darkness, dream of beautiful spring days... It's a stillness of the forest. But suddenly the forest echoes with human voices, the sound of calves, the barking of dogs: those who have gone away for the winter - they are resting somewhere.
Fires now light up the plain. The mules are relieved of their burdens, the sheep are chasing after the blighted grass. The sky, earlier brightened, is brightening unnoticed; and with it the souls of the shepherds, dreary hitherto. The whistles began to sing of the young men's longings; the songs of the lads made the plain resound far away. Mountains and valleys were awakening; as were the forests. All around was cheered - by the innocent goodwill of men. The moon rose high in the sky, and the fires were dying one by one. The Armenians slept now, light sleep, under the open sky - like their lives.
Only one soul was suffering during this time, a young man, young and vigorous, like all the people of the mountain. He watched the fire burning... burning like his heart. He did not say a word, tormented by thoughts that came to him in a jumble, confused, without any order, that nothing could be understood from them; they were so many, that you could make out in them his tormented life: here he was, small, an orphan, then older, alone - with no one to tell him... And then, one Saint Mary's Day, a dear heart came his way, a girl with the soul of an angel, yes - that's what she was - with whom he suddenly got along: they shared each other's desires, they both wept for joy, and since then... At the thought, his brow flushed with cold sweat, his eyes moistened... and, without further thought, he stood up and looked longingly towards the village.
All around, heavy silence: on the vault, the stars twinkled softly, the bright moon went its way, filling the woods with light. And the Aromanians slept sweetly... Deep stillness in heaven and on earth; but in Dinu's breast the storm was raging. The stillness of the place, however, seemed to soothe the hurricane in his soul, and so - he sat down again by the fire, to grind thoughts further. But even now, dark thoughts, darker even, were still overwhelming him... cries echoed in his ears... and long, dark shadows played across his face... He closed his eyes for a moment, so that he could no longer see... and then the pure icon of the one who troubled his soul so much came to his mind: far away, in the village, his dear Vira was left alone, with her father - the village watchman, to mourn her days, and her life, only troubles, and what the winter would bring...
The image of his girlfriend had him stunned... and he didn't think twice. He got up, as if bitten by some bad dream, he put his hand on a stick, called his sheepdog from the sheepfold, and set off for the village, to rejoice his daughter who understood his longing and his tears, to free her from hard living... He hurried on, like a stranger who has come close to his own place and is eager to embrace his own as soon as possible.
The village, lost in darkness, dreamed a grey, autumn dream. From the forest a raucous whirlwind was blowing, about to uproot the trees, shaking everything in its path; as if mares - escaped from heavy chains - were rushing over the people's settlements. It begins to light up, and the snow is spread in layers over the whole village. The dwellings were empty, dark, only one little house, with a large, deserted courtyard, was lit by a candle... Inside, by the hearth, there worked a girl with cheeks as bright as jars, with large, sorrowful eyes, with flowing, silken hair; she was like a golden apple dropped here, in the poverty of the house. The girl was working, dear to her, and the tears that streamed down her face might have quenched the ember in the fire next door. Outside, snow flurries were pounding against the papery windows... The girl, heavy with thought, felt warm tears on her cheeks.
Long and sad is the story of this pure soul, overwhelmed by troubles: left without parents since she was a child, she was taken by the soul, by the village watchman, a drunkard who left her alone for days on end, alone in the house, with only a bushel of dry bread; and when this drunkard came back from wherever he was, she had to endure his heavy arm, because he beat her... He'd beat her till she was flat on the floor. And the girl put up with all that... She endured it, hoping that one day she would be saved from this dog's life, because somewhere there was another being who thought of her... It was her dear Dinu, who had so often spoken of a different, happier life...
That's what the poor girl was thinking about that dark night, and her tears were flowing without restraint...
It was past midnight, and outside the snow had stopped altogether; the wind had died too, and the village lay under a white shroud of snow.
The girl was still working by the fire... and sleepless as she was - she could no longer close her eyes, above all - she was torn by thoughts: sometimes she seemed to see her beloved Dinu far away, in the field, and she felt his eyes looking at her... at other times she seemed to hear his sweet voice, calling her to run away with him... to run away - who knows where and escape this hard life... But did she not now hear Dinu's whistle? It was a mournful sound, and the song came down from the hills, echoing beautifully, all the way down here to her bedroom. Suddenly a shudder seized her, and a strange laugh burst from her lips, then she collapsed on the cold hearth.
Outside, the village was still filled with Dinu's flute playing, because he was the singer... He left the field, walked for hours, and - towards dawn, entered the alleys. He wanted to go straight to Vira's house, to cheer her up - because he knew she was upset, but her father... that hateful soul would have felt it, and then she was even worse off.
That is why, when he was on the edge of the hill, the lad once again sang their dear song, which he used to tell them in the summer from the fair.
Wait a minute... But from Vira's house - no sign, no voice, just a flickering light inside. He wanted to blow his whistle once more, but the whistle seemed to have died, it didn't make another sound... She threw it on the snow, and started from her mouth, the very song of Virai, that she used to say when she went to the fair or to the well:
Girl - pear eyes,
My dear Armenian,
Don't be late
In the evening, at the fountain.
And stop cooking yourself
All of it, in the ass,
That the children will kidnap you,
Turned him home.
And stop wearing, to the hori,
Specifically, the Albumen,
That you are fooling the children -
And swarm the world...
And Dinu sang with so much fire, with so much longing, that even the deserted village was in pain. The empty and silent houses awoke to his voice, familiar to them, and they worshipped him... ...as if they, too, suffered with him. He paused for a moment, waiting. He felt the joy of a grown child, when he thought that in a little while he would be near his darling and wipe the tears from his cheeks... But time seemed to fly... here, from the east, the dawn was breaking. Sensing this, Dinu hurried downstairs.
It was a bit cold, and every now and then the wind blew hard, hitting the boy in the face, but Dinu walked on through the village still in the pre-dawn darkness. When he reached the other watchman's house, he looked out of the window: a blazing fire was burning in the hearth, and the watchmen were sitting beside it.
A dog sensed him, barked, held on to him and quickly turned around. Dinu walked on, not looking behind him... he wanted to be as close as possible to where he had set out to be.
The dog's bark woke up the guards, drunk all night from the wine. They realized that someone had entered the village, a stranger. Uncle Virai grabbed a hatchet, grabbed a piece of wood - to light it if necessary - and jumped out. There, noticing the trampled snow - he stopped calling the others and ran to his household. The morning chill woke him even more, and even invigorated him.
Near the house, he noticed a shadow moving... He approaches it... His head was heavy as lead, his legs were not quite holding him, but he felt his arms tense as they rose and struck out hard, without his will... The sickle thundered, and on the spot - a tall body rolled heavily in the snow, while a muffled voice murmured faintly, "Ah, God - I'm done for!"
The watchman shuddered in horror... His voice was familiar; and therefore he understood his reckless act... He was lost, he didn't know what to do, and - suddenly, with axe in hand, with his shirt and his rope splattered with blood - he ran into the house!
Vira woke up, frightened. Seeing her uncle covered in blood, she screamed... He raised his axe and said softly, threateningly:
- Shut up... shut up - that I ate it fried...
Vira was silent... And though she didn't understand a word of what was going on, she didn't dare ask a question.
The watchman, still drunk from the wine, and - perhaps to a greater extent - from the blood on his shirt and his coat... could not stand it any longer, fell into a corner and suddenly, as if stunned, fell asleep... after nights of sleeplessness and drunkenness.
Towards dawn, dawn is breaking. The house was out in the open and had never before been in complete darkness. He was flying, as if he were from another world; he could remember nothing, understand nothing of what he saw around him.
Outside the wind whistled for a long time, as if it were blowing... Vira went out into the courtyard, but turned back as if bitten by a snake, when she saw the reddening snow, and heard a terrible voice coming towards her... She was stunned in the house... She felt like crying, and she didn't know why; she would have thought of something, but she didn't know what, because everything was meaningless and confusing to her.
Next door, her uncle snored in his monstrous sleep, which scared her even more. She went out again and set off after the blood. She'd barely understood... A lake of blood and - in the middle of it - her dear Dinu, face up, lying on the ground; Vira screams briefly... and slips beside the boy.
The wind gently caressed their cheeks... It's like a horse... I was pitying these two tormented young men, with their pure souls, true angels.
Light pours over the village. Dinu and Vira are still lying in the snow, and the guards are sleeping soundly, sleeping hard; in the alleys, not a sound. But the wind is blowing even colder; snowflakes rarely fall on the two. The snowflakes woke the girl, who began to show signs of life... She was coming out of her faint. A few moments later she stirred restlessly, opened her eyes wide and jumped up as if on fire! She felt light and strong again... singing, screaming... laughing like never before in her life. Then, grabbing Dinu, she pulled him into the house. She left him there, and again roaring with laughter..., again screaming, singing, then she went out of the house again. She started running, barefoot, through the village... Running towards the church. There she rang the big bell, as if she had set out to gather the whole village - to mourn her dear Dinu...
At the ringing of the bell, the village rang - deserted... Then the silence fell again...
Vira returned home... Singing, laughing... She put on her festive clothes and went out again...
The girl, poor thing, had gone mad.
