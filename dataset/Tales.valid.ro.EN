THE WOLF AND THE FOX
It was - what wasn't.
Once there was a wolf, - Cumatran-Nicola, and a fox, - Cumatran-Mara.
These two came together to hunt together, and the game, they said to each other, they would share it brotherly.
Going out hunting, but I come across a pot of honey.
- Aha!," rushed Cumătru-Nicola, "a pap!
- First and foremost you don't have to say "o pap!", but "o păpăm", said Cumătra-Mara. Then, don't even think about it, I didn't even hit the pot, and that's it: go for it! If you want to make a home together, know that we don't do it by swallowing every penny...
- Be it, Mara, as you know.
- Yes, as I know! Let's do like everyone else. Now, for example, we hide the honey and every three days we go and eat it.
They did as the sly Cumahtra-Mara said: they hid the honey under a juniper tree.
Not a day goes by and behold, the fox bitch tells the wolf:
- Master Nicola, someone's calling me to baptize them!
- If he calls you, go!" said the wolf.
The fox went over and - lip-lip! - swallowed the honey from above, because that's where it came from, that was its baptism.
On the way back the wolf asked her:
- What name did you give the baby, Mother-in-law?
- The beginning! What else would I call the first boy in the man's house?
- Nice name! Long live you! - the wolf cried.
The next day the fox - again:
- Cumetre-Nicola, calling me to baptize again.
- Well, go, if he calls you!
Off goes the fox and - lip-lip!, he halved the honey pot.
When she came back, the wolf asked her again:
- What name did you give him, Howdy Doody?
- I called him Halfling, because he was a girl this time.
Another day passes, and the fox:
- Master Nicola, and today he calls me to baptize!
Wolf-wolf, how can he understand that this isn't clean? "Go!". So he said.
Now the fox has cooked all the honey in the pot!
Returning from there, Cumătru-Nicola asks again, curious:
- Well, what did you call the new baby?
- The fox, who knew that he had put all the honey in the right place, said.
- Nice name, - long live you, hates the silly wolf.
The three days had just passed, and now he had to go and taste the honey. But what else was there to taste? Stones? Because the fox had eaten all the honey.
- Cumetre-Nicola, Cumetre-Nicola, - you've been grazing the honey yourself, as I see it, said the fox.
- Forgive me, Countess Face," said the wolf, "but it seems to me that you have made this wonderful little chore!
He, that you, she, that you - they fought and broke up.
The fox started towards the village to catch a hen. On the way she meets a priest. The shepherd was walking home from the church with his donkey loaded with springs. She saw him from a distance and lay down by the path, pretending to be dead. The priest, seeing her, took her by the leg and threw her on the donkey on top of the spices. "She's good," said the man to himself, "a fur for my priestess!"
The fox, in the back, unties the sacks and throws the prescriptions one by one, all of them, into the road. Then she gets down and again - one by one - picks them all up and - that's your way! She arrives with the spices in the forest. Here is Jupân-Nicola. He asks in astonishment:
- Where did you come from, Mara?
- Where would it come from, Cumetre-Nicola? Well, from the church!
- But how did they give them to you? How did you do it?
- How did you do it? How was I supposed to do it? I went to the door of the church and started to chop the priest: give me, my fathers, a sprinkle! - give me, my fathers, a sprinkle! What could the priest do? He gave me a whole bag instead of a spice!
- Then I'll go too. Can I have one?
- Of course not! How could you not?!
The wolf wastes no time, and there he is - at church. He sticks his head through the door and starts howling - wolf, what a thing!
- Give me, Father, a prescription! Give me a prescription, Father!
- Huooo, lupe! Whoo, wolf! - everyone starts shouting - the wolf didn't know how to make himself invisible from there.
So, he was back in the forest. The fox came out before him and asked him how he was doing. The wolf told him what had happened to him and how they would scare him if they got him.
- But tell me, how did you ask, the fox asked.
- Well, there you go: Give me, Father, a prescription!
- Well, that's why he didn't give it to you, Cumetre-Nicola. You have to ask in a lower voice, not like that - screaming! Softly, softly, that's the way to ask: "Give me, my fathers, a prescription".
The fool of a wolf, who had once escaped with his life, let himself be led by the fox's nose, and went once more, to ask now... in a lower voice. Only, poor Cumberland didn't even get his head through the door, and the world: "Hooo, on him!" with dogs, with dogs, and burn him, and burn him with their hair, till they kill him!
And with that, the fox got rid of the mischievous wolf.
THE THREE SLOTHS
It was - what I never mentioned!
There were once three lazy men, Mitu, Pitu and Chitu - like you wouldn't believe. Lazy as they were, they ate once every three days.
They leave, go to a village. But lest any should tire a step more - they grasped each other behind the shoulders, and when one lifted his leg, to stretch it further, the others moved!
All the way - they didn't say a word out of their mouths, not a word of cure; if you had seen them, you would have said they were dumb. Suddenly, one of them spots a lyre in their path. And, not to say many words, he just said, "There it is!" That was Mitu. "Who...?", said Pitu; "let them take it...", added Chitu; "you bastards!", ended Mitu.
Well, sure - coughs, otherwise how can only one bend?
The three of them grab the lyre, in a big hurry, after taking about an hour to bend down and then stand up again. And, out of laziness, so that only one of them would not hold the yellow one, they all held it with one finger each!
Yavash-yavas, yavash-yavas reached the village they had left for and pulled up at an inn. The innkeeper - to faint with laughter, when he saw the state they were in. But, seeing the lyre in their hands, he did not mock them, but received them kindly and asked them what they wanted.
- Pie, meat, wine, yogurt - they said.
The devil, the innkeeper, didn't stay around much; he heard what they wanted, he made them a pie, he cooked their meat, he filled them a cup of wine and brought them a plate of yogurt. He set the table for them, filled their yolks, and left them in the Lord's payment.
All good, but who's gonna cut the pie now? I'm sitting with my hands against the wall and closing my eyes... Whoever moves it first, or talks - that's who'll cut it. But, you've found who'll talk or move! They sit like icons on the walls in the church.
A beggar, one of those who go around people's doors, also passes by their door at the inn, pokes his head into the room and begins to pray:
- Make yourselves alms, people...
But when he saw that they weren't moving at all, he kept getting closer, slowly, slowly. And as he came closer, closer, the smell of the pie sprang to his nostrils, and the man wasted no time, and laid it down before him - and give it to him, and burn it - first the top sheet, then the nettles with eggs, cheese and milk in it, then the edges, and the bottom sheet - nothing left, not a crumb.
Only when he finishes eating the pie, he starts to eat the meat, you'd think he was starving - he'd just come out of fasting, so hungry was he and he was hungry!
After he had put the meat on well, he had an appetite for wine. But the beggar lifted up the cup, and - gobble-gobble, gobble-gobble - until there was not a drop left. Once this little cup was done, the man was drunk, for it had gone to his head. Here he is, talking to himself - who is he, there's no one like him! At last he took hold and plastered the lazy man's mouths with yoghurt, then he gathered up what was left of the dishes, and washed the pot!
As he leaves, a dog enters the room and goes after the leftovers from the feast. When he sees that no one chases him away, he approaches the three lazy ones and starts licking them; he licks one, moves on to the other, and when he gets to the third one, he doesn't know what to do or what to do, because he bites him on the ear, and he bites this one to his knees.
He couldn't take it anymore and howled:
- Ow, woe is me!
As soon as they heard him "woe is me!" - the other two, in one voice, cried out:
- Cut the pie, because you talked!
What a pie to cut, the Lord would cut them out of heaven - there was no cure left.
And that's what happened to those lazy, lazy bastards.
QUICK-WITTED GIRL
It is said that once upon a time - and it's a long time since then - there lived an emperor who was an Abraham and a pagan. For who knows what, he punished the poor people terribly. So, woe to those who fell into his hands!
No one escaped his malice, a proud and beautiful man like an angel, who - who knows what he had done, that the emperor had thrown him in prison and ordered that nothing be given him to eat, to leave him there to die of hunger. No one, friend or foe, was allowed to go and see him. Only the daughter of the imprisoned man, a widow with an infant child, was allowed to visit him twice a day. But even she was thoroughly searched before going to her father's house - lest she hide something to eat. It broke the poor girl's heart with pity to see that her poor father was growing weaker day by day, and after four days, when she went to him and saw him faint with hunger, she felt so sorry for him that she gave him suck at her breast. From then on she weaned her babe, and twice a day she bent over her father, as to a babe, to feed him.
In this way, she was able to save him from death and, after a long struggle, she found a way to save him from prison. The girl knew that the emperor went out every day to ride on a horse that ran like a smeu in a fairy tale.
Thinking of what she had in her head, the girl pretended to be stupid and, at the palace gate, when she went out and when the emperor came in, she said this song:
Emperor handsome,
Squeeze your runaway horse,
That too flies like the wind,
If you don't understand my word.
Your horse is not born,
But his mum still helps him.
From the prison wilderness,
Get out, ladies, back in the sun
The man I feed at my breast
And he's the master of his mother.
A few days went by like that. The emperor kept hearing the song - both when he left and when he came back, but he thought the girl was stupid, and didn't take any notice of her words.
One day, the girl sang with so much lament, that the king stopped his horse to hear better the words that, now, no longer seemed to be those of a fool. He called her to his side and asked her what she meant: "horse that is not born, but still his mother helps him" and "man that I feed at his breast, and is his mother's master". The girl said that the horse he was riding was not foaled by the mare, but was taken from her womb, for she could not foal him, so he was born as a colt, and the mare's skin was made into a saddle, which was put on the horse. So she knew from her aunt. Then she told the king that she knew of a man who, as he had commanded, had been thrown into prison and left there hungry; this man is her father, and so that he might not starve, she feeds him as a baby at her breast.
When the king heard this, and saw how wise she was and how much love she had for her father, his heart was so softened that he immediately released the prisoner from prison, and gave the girl a bag of coins.
