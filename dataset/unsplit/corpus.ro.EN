With her boundless love, shown to her aunt, and with her keen mind, this girl managed to save the man from certain death!
- If so, then tomorrow at eight o'clock we'll go there together.
He takes the bird to the crane - and honours the crane, and praises him everywhere. The vizier was dying of grief. "Don't hurry," he said to his son, "or you'll never get rid of me! I'll cook it for you, you'll see!" And then he slipped it to his wife:
The beauty of the world hearing the misfortune - that they have killed her man, takes the water-glass, sprinkles her man and resurrects him on the spot. Then she says to him:
He sat down on the porch and considered whether to go up, or not to go up at all. He took heart, and went in, for he was no coward.
- I sell, but on lies!
They see her, they rush at her, they slap her mouth, tie her hands behind her back and - to the mountain with her!
- Money! I want money!" he said again.
- Mom, don't I have a father? Only other kids do, buying them all kinds of goodies?
- Come home and get it!
The emperor, when he heard so - the sky fell on him. The bullet would have pierced him - and no blood would have flowed from him.
We left Baiasa a bit late and could not reach Avdela until night. There were three of us, and we were all in good spirits. My companions on the road knew the haiduci, the masters of the night, so I had no worries.
- We're listening!
- Come on, buddy, it smells like gunpowder around here! Let's wash up!
What about the nose? How much she was bruised, and - because of it - how many scandals, how many spats at the fountain, with the girls who - damn them, they called her... a nose like a furnace! In his youth - he had a fight with a neighbour and for forty years he didn't speak to her! Should she tell her, the impudent one, that under her nose, Cuscuta's nose that is - seven flocks of sheep could be sheltered?!
How the years go by and how the world gets worse!
It was getting dark. The stars flickered across the sky. Willing or not, Mitu's Tegă stayed at the fair. The shepherds set to work: one drew the lamb in the skewer and lit the fire, another got foliage, twigs from the forest, which he then used to prepare a hut and a bed, a soft bed, only made of green hay, for the guest... Then the three of them lay down by the fire, the fire had now subsided, the fire-pan was browning beautifully over the rich hearth, dripping with fat, and pouring out steam, what steam - full of scents! Through the trees, through their branches, the moon crept, and it seemed as if the forest grew and moved in the beat of its cold, silent rays, which filled the solitude with mystery. The shadows of the mountains stretched endlessly under the moon. A night bird fluttered its wings over them unseen.
HAIDA
In the Romanian villages of S. and M., a big wedding is held, starting eight days before the wedding and ending eight days after. The bachelor Bucuvală, marries his son, Chita, to the daughter of the bachelor Nastu, from M. In both villages, from the small to the big, they are happy that their bachelors are getting married. Only one soul, Nastu's Haida, the girl after whom she is to be a bride for seven days, is very sad and heartbroken with grief at the thought that one day she will be the wife of Bucuvală's Chita. She, the beautiful and proud Haidă, she - the only offspring of the renowned Nastu - to take an ugly, graceless and always sickly, like Chita, - better, death!
Fifteen years have passed since Haida's engagement. She was only two at the time and Chita was five. Nastu had sworn his daughter to Bucuvală's son, and they had remained cousins ever since. They raised their children, but as beautiful and wonderful as Haida was, Chita was ugly, suffering, weak in body and mind. But Bucuvală was a great one, his herds were many, as were caravans of mules as beautiful as angels. Chitu was not to be taken out into the world, but with so much wealth - he could live well with Haida. That's what Nastu and his wife thought - and it never crossed their minds that Haida wouldn't want Chita. Besides, what if he didn't want him - what could he do, would he dare to oppose them? Was it possible to ruin such an old encuscrement? The girl knew this, and when she thought of what lay ahead of her, she sighed and wept tears as big as plums. And now, when she saw that the time was drawing near to enter Cheita's house, from dawn till dusk she would still weep.
Her parents didn't understand why the girl was upset, because when they asked her - why are you crying? she answered that it was for them, that she would leave them alone, and again she was drowning in tears...
Nastu had a shepherd, Chendra, so handsome and handsome that you wanted to take his head and go with him. And this Chendra talked like he had honey in his mouth. She was very fond of him, and when she saw him, it was as if she saw the sun, and so - about nothing at all - for hours she would talk to him, often even scolding him when he was late coming down from the sheep, and when someone else came for bread, she would do what she did and give him too little, so that he would make Chendra come down to the village himself.
The week of the wedding, Chendra was in the village. He could see Haida with teary eyes, but it was not in his power to ask her why she was crying. On Thursday, when they had dressed her as a bride, Haida cried so much that when he saw her in the evening he could not stop: he approached her and in his sweet voice said:
- Forgive me, Haida, for speaking to you, but - please - tell me: what are you crying about all day?
- Alas, alas - Chendra, you, Chendra - if you were in my heart! Come a little closer, like this - let me tell you what trouble I'm in.
In the garden, under a cherry tree, the girl, her eyes brimming with tears, began to tell him:
- Don't you know, my boy, that my folks are marrying me, that next Sunday I'll be the wife of that ugly, cursed Cheetah? Look at me, you - who have known me for years: do I match Chita? Does it suit me to go out with him, to go out in the world with that rascal? Isn't it a pity of my pride, to close my life with one like him? I don't want his wealth, nor the fringe of his name, nor his house, - but I would love a man, - not to be ashamed of him when he takes me out into the world. Ah, Chendra brother, - did you really not notice how my heart would swell when I saw you come from the sheep, how I loved to talk with you, endlessly?
And, crying stops her talking. Chendra, poor thing, who would never have believed that a celnic girl, especially one like Haida, could think of him, even love him - had swallowed his words whole when he heard what he heard from Haida. He was silent too, and so was Haida, who was always crying. Finally, Haida said again:
- Listen, Chendra - two things escape me about Chita: you, or this... And that's when he pulled a knife out of his pocket. Either we both run away, far away - where no one around here will see us, and there we can live together as we please, or on Sunday, when I enter the church in Chita's village, so that no one will put the crown on my head - with this knife I'll escape the shame that people want to put on me.
- Well, Haida, but - you, a celestial girl, a beauty and a mind like no one's, how can you be with a shepherd, like me?
- Listen here, Chendra: you're a good, hardworking, handsome boy. As for my heart, and many a time I was ready to ask Daddy to give me up for you, but knowing his temper... That's why, Chendra, don't let me die by the knife. Tomorrow's Friday, Saturday the cousins are coming for me. In the evening we'll stop at the spring, up at our cabin. There, all the others will party, sing, play... I'll stake out the right moment, sneak away from the spits, you come after me and - both of us, run away, escape this evil world. What do you say?
Chendra, what to say, was taken aback, hearing these words, and, after some thought, said to the girl:
- Come on, baby, either I die with you or we run away together on Saturday night. Become a bride, Haido, and - God with us!
- God help us!" said the girl, and they parted. Haida is calmer, now she no longer cries, but - with a heart full of joy, she is a bride, like all brides...
Saturday arrived, and the many, many, many cousins came to pick up their bride. Come on, in a silk dress and a handkerchief to match, with a veil on her head, with a sprinkling of yellow up to her waist, you'd have thought she was a fairy. They put her on a horse and rode off to Cheita's village. There were so many people there, the like of which had never been seen at any other wedding. Chendra wore the bride's horse by the bridle, but if you looked closely, you could see that he was in deep thought.
In the evening they reached Nastu's stable and there ten shepherds were cutting and cleaning the noateni, while as many were setting the jars to put them on the spit. Five horses laden with barrels of wine were also stripped - but Nastu still said it wouldn't be enough. The feast began with brandy, and when the skewers were ready - fifteen shepherds were pouring wine to the worshippers - there still weren't enough. There was singing and hopping of the cubs, so that it seemed as if you were on some other world!
Time was running out, and when the wine was running low, few people were left awake. Haida pretended to be asleep, and when all around her had closed their eyes too, - as she was dressed, bride - she slipped lightly away from her cousins and then hurried down to the valley, where Chendra had descended. Both of them, - nights and days they went on and on, away, way for weeks.
The wedding is broken. Nastu and his family returned to the village. But the poor man was so ashamed - he grew old in just one day, as if countless years had passed over him. When he returned to the village, he commanded that the name of Haida should never be mentioned in his house again.
Twenty-five years have passed since then. It was a Saturday, around noon. Almost all the Romans of the village of M. had gone out into the orchard near their settlement, where the young men were caught up in the horde, and the old men were watching them from the sidelines, many of them feeling very sorry that their legs would not help them to hop about a little.
Three travellers could be seen in the sky, coming on horseback. They got up and stopped right next to the village elders. Leading them was a young man, proud and handsome as an angel. He had such dignity in his eyes that the elders rose to their feet when the boy, dismounting, bade them good day. The hour stopped too, and all the world had eyes only for the travellers. By their dress, they did not seem to be local people, almost. After a good meal, as is the Aromanian custom, one of the old men told the young traveller that there was no inn in the village, but if he wished to honour his house, he invited him to be his guest tonight. The young man ordered his companions to take his horses and, accompanied by a lad, they led them into the village. When the hour broke, towards evening, the traveller, with a company of men, went to the host who had invited him for a rest, where they stayed for a while.
In appearance, this young man looked like someone from the village - and many old men talked about it among themselves, but no one could quite make out who he looked like.
The next morning, in church, to honour the young man, they placed him next to the village leaders. And next to him sat Nastu, who never took his eyes off the young traveller during the service.
Since that black day, when Nastu suffered the shame of his life, that his wife ran away from him, many times - people from the village, as well as strangers, wanted to talk about Haida, but he stopped any discussion - who wants to be at my heart, he said - don't talk to me about it. Nastu himself never mentioned the girl in the house.
Now, the older man, the more he looked at the boy, the more he felt he wanted, from his heart, to talk to him.
Outside the church, people in the courtyard, in groups of five or six, were arranging their visits to be made, and further away, old Nastu, leaning on his staff, was still shooting at the young stranger out of the corner of his eye. When the old woman came out of the church, the stick called her to him, and after whispering a few words to her, she turned her eyes to the traveller. It seemed as if the old woman's heart was also taken away.
The world dispersed, and the two old men slowly left too.
When they got home, the old lady - as never before - didn't know how best to decorate her guest room. Her heart was full of joy and she even told her that something new, something good was going to happen in this house today. From time to time, he would go out to the gate to see if the stranger was coming towards them.
Around noon, indeed, a group of people, with the young traveller among them, came to visit old Nastu. The old woman's legs were trembling, and the old man's heart was beating so hard, it was as if it were beating out of his chest. There was talk of one thing and another, but Nastu wasn't paying any attention, he kept fretting how to get the stranger to ask where he was from. The young man helped him, because he started it himself, about that.
- You bastard, I noticed, even in church, that you look at me on purpose. Maybe you want to know who I am. I've come a long way. There's a great celibate living in our house. God has given him everything, but his wife has an unquenchable thirst: she's too far from her parents and hasn't seen them for a long time. Knowing that they are passing by, she asked me to bring you their good wishes - you and your wife, many good wishes. But why to you in particular and not to someone else here in the village, I don't know.
- Tell me, mother dear," said Maia Nastu, "isn't that woman called Haida? And is she related to you in some way?
- If I knew you were fond of that celiac and his wife, Haida, I'd tell you how I'm related to them.
- How can we not be fond of Haida, my son," the old woman rushed, "since she is our daughter?
- Then know that I am Haida's boy, and I come to hear it from you - if you have forgiven her....
The old woman couldn't help herself; she rushed to her nephew and started kissing him, she couldn't get enough. Poor old Nastu, you'd have thought he'd frozen where he sat. One of the guests took him by the arm and led him to his nephew, who kissed his hand, and the old man in turn kissed the boy on the forehead, while his eyes filled with tears.
At lunch and dinner, the grandson was the guest of old Nastu, and after another two months, the celnic Chendra with Haida, with all the household, with the flocks of sheep, the caravans of horses - they came to the village of M.
Old Nastu's house, which had been locked up for so many years, has opened up to the world again. Chendra and Haida, nice as they were in their youth, loved and honoured the old people beyond measure. They, who had never wanted to know anything in their long loneliness, were now no longer tired of life - and they lived for many more years, raising grandchildren and grandchildren's grandchildren.
GRANDDAUGHTER OF A SECURITY GUARD
The mountains were deserted.
The flocks of sheep came down to winter... the shepherds are nowhere to be seen... families - in caravans - have also left... The village, alone now, is bewailing its fate. The woods are rustling, as if they were confessing their longing for their friends who have gone far, far away, who brought with them the joys and hopes of the place.
The dear songs in the flute have gone silent, the proud aromatics are no longer heard humming. The sharp wind has taken their place, sweeping the leaves away and filling the whole village with them... The wind awakens the village as if from a heavy dream, and then moves on, whistling through the rocky valleys of the mountains.
How sad autumn descends here, how many of those who fall in love do not part... How many loves does it not make languish and even fade, forever!
The small, cold rain, which seemed as if it would never hold off, has now stood. Up through the cracks in the ragged clouds, the faint rays of sunlight crept, almost perished, as flocks and men and caravans trudged up the mountain slope.
The farmers were urging their horses on, knowing that beyond the bend lay the plateau where they would make a restful rest.
Through deep valleys - the sun doesn't penetrate at all. Shadows begin to lengthen over mountains and over meadows, first as a grey light, then as a black shroud... black, under which the forests disappear into silence. The plains, also plunged in darkness, dream of beautiful spring days... It's a stillness of the forest. But suddenly the forest echoes with human voices, the sound of calves, the barking of dogs: those who have gone away for the winter - they are resting somewhere.
Fires now light up the plain. The mules are relieved of their burdens, the sheep are chasing after the blighted grass. The sky, earlier brightened, is brightening unnoticed; and with it the souls of the shepherds, dreary hitherto. The whistles began to sing of the young men's longings; the songs of the lads made the plain resound far away. Mountains and valleys were awakening; as were the forests. All around was cheered - by the innocent goodwill of men. The moon rose high in the sky, and the fires were dying one by one. The Armenians slept now, light sleep, under the open sky - like their lives.
Only one soul was suffering during this time, a young man, young and vigorous, like all the people of the mountain. He watched the fire burning... burning like his heart. He did not say a word, tormented by thoughts that came to him in a jumble, confused, without any order, that nothing could be understood from them; they were so many, that you could make out in them his tormented life: here he was, small, an orphan, then older, alone - with no one to tell him... And then, one Saint Mary's Day, a dear heart came his way, a girl with the soul of an angel, yes - that's what she was - with whom he suddenly got along: they shared each other's desires, they both wept for joy, and since then... At the thought, his brow flushed with cold sweat, his eyes moistened... and, without further thought, he stood up and looked longingly towards the village.
All around, heavy silence: on the vault, the stars twinkled softly, the bright moon went its way, filling the woods with light. And the Aromanians slept sweetly... Deep stillness in heaven and on earth; but in Dinu's breast the storm was raging. The stillness of the place, however, seemed to soothe the hurricane in his soul, and so - he sat down again by the fire, to grind thoughts further. But even now, dark thoughts, darker even, were still overwhelming him... cries echoed in his ears... and long, dark shadows played across his face... He closed his eyes for a moment, so that he could no longer see... and then the pure icon of the one who troubled his soul so much came to his mind: far away, in the village, his dear Vira was left alone, with her father - the village watchman, to mourn her days, and her life, only troubles, and what the winter would bring...
The image of his girlfriend had him stunned... and he didn't think twice. He got up, as if bitten by some bad dream, he put his hand on a stick, called his sheepdog from the sheepfold, and set off for the village, to rejoice his daughter who understood his longing and his tears, to free her from hard living... He hurried on, like a stranger who has come close to his own place and is eager to embrace his own as soon as possible.
The village, lost in darkness, dreamed a grey, autumn dream. From the forest a raucous whirlwind was blowing, about to uproot the trees, shaking everything in its path; as if mares - escaped from heavy chains - were rushing over the people's settlements. It begins to light up, and the snow is spread in layers over the whole village. The dwellings were empty, dark, only one little house, with a large, deserted courtyard, was lit by a candle... Inside, by the hearth, there worked a girl with cheeks as bright as jars, with large, sorrowful eyes, with flowing, silken hair; she was like a golden apple dropped here, in the poverty of the house. The girl was working, dear to her, and the tears that streamed down her face might have quenched the ember in the fire next door. Outside, snow flurries were pounding against the papery windows... The girl, heavy with thought, felt warm tears on her cheeks.
Long and sad is the story of this pure soul, overwhelmed by troubles: left without parents since she was a child, she was taken by the soul, by the village watchman, a drunkard who left her alone for days on end, alone in the house, with only a bushel of dry bread; and when this drunkard came back from wherever he was, she had to endure his heavy arm, because he beat her... He'd beat her till she was flat on the floor. And the girl put up with all that... She endured it, hoping that one day she would be saved from this dog's life, because somewhere there was another being who thought of her... It was her dear Dinu, who had so often spoken of a different, happier life...
That's what the poor girl was thinking about that dark night, and her tears were flowing without restraint...
It was past midnight, and outside the snow had stopped altogether; the wind had died too, and the village lay under a white shroud of snow.
The girl was still working by the fire... and sleepless as she was - she could no longer close her eyes, above all - she was torn by thoughts: sometimes she seemed to see her beloved Dinu far away, in the field, and she felt his eyes looking at her... at other times she seemed to hear his sweet voice, calling her to run away with him... to run away - who knows where and escape this hard life... But did she not now hear Dinu's whistle? It was a mournful sound, and the song came down from the hills, echoing beautifully, all the way down here to her bedroom. Suddenly a shudder seized her, and a strange laugh burst from her lips, then she collapsed on the cold hearth.
Outside, the village was still filled with Dinu's flute playing, because he was the singer... He left the field, walked for hours, and - towards dawn, entered the alleys. He wanted to go straight to Vira's house, to cheer her up - because he knew she was upset, but her father... that hateful soul would have felt it, and then she was even worse off.
That is why, when he was on the edge of the hill, the lad once again sang their dear song, which he used to tell them in the summer from the fair.
Wait a minute... But from Vira's house - no sign, no voice, just a flickering light inside. He wanted to blow his whistle once more, but the whistle seemed to have died, it didn't make another sound... She threw it on the snow, and started from her mouth, the very song of Virai, that she used to say when she went to the fair or to the well:
Girl - pear eyes,
My dear Armenian,
Don't be late
In the evening, at the fountain.
And stop cooking yourself
All of it, in the ass,
That the children will kidnap you,
Turned him home.
And stop wearing, to the hori,
Specifically, the Albumen,
That you are fooling the children -
And swarm the world...
And Dinu sang with so much fire, with so much longing, that even the deserted village was in pain. The empty and silent houses awoke to his voice, familiar to them, and they worshipped him... ...as if they, too, suffered with him. He paused for a moment, waiting. He felt the joy of a grown child, when he thought that in a little while he would be near his darling and wipe the tears from his cheeks... But time seemed to fly... here, from the east, the dawn was breaking. Sensing this, Dinu hurried downstairs.
It was a bit cold, and every now and then the wind blew hard, hitting the boy in the face, but Dinu walked on through the village still in the pre-dawn darkness. When he reached the other watchman's house, he looked out of the window: a blazing fire was burning in the hearth, and the watchmen were sitting beside it.
A dog sensed him, barked, held on to him and quickly turned around. Dinu walked on, not looking behind him... he wanted to be as close as possible to where he had set out to be.
The dog's bark woke up the guards, drunk all night from the wine. They realized that someone had entered the village, a stranger. Uncle Virai grabbed a hatchet, grabbed a piece of wood - to light it if necessary - and jumped out. There, noticing the trampled snow - he stopped calling the others and ran to his household. The morning chill woke him even more, and even invigorated him.
Near the house, he noticed a shadow moving... He approaches it... His head was heavy as lead, his legs were not quite holding him, but he felt his arms tense as they rose and struck out hard, without his will... The sickle thundered, and on the spot - a tall body rolled heavily in the snow, while a muffled voice murmured faintly, "Ah, God - I'm done for!"
The watchman shuddered in horror... His voice was familiar; and therefore he understood his reckless act... He was lost, he didn't know what to do, and - suddenly, with axe in hand, with his shirt and his rope splattered with blood - he ran into the house!
Vira woke up, frightened. Seeing her uncle covered in blood, she screamed... He raised his axe and said softly, threateningly:
- Shut up... shut up - that I ate it fried...
Vira was silent... And though she didn't understand a word of what was going on, she didn't dare ask a question.
The watchman, still drunk from the wine, and - perhaps to a greater extent - from the blood on his shirt and his coat... could not stand it any longer, fell into a corner and suddenly, as if stunned, fell asleep... after nights of sleeplessness and drunkenness.
Towards dawn, dawn is breaking. The house was out in the open and had never before been in complete darkness. He was flying, as if he were from another world; he could remember nothing, understand nothing of what he saw around him.
Outside the wind whistled for a long time, as if it were blowing... Vira went out into the courtyard, but turned back as if bitten by a snake, when she saw the reddening snow, and heard a terrible voice coming towards her... She was stunned in the house... She felt like crying, and she didn't know why; she would have thought of something, but she didn't know what, because everything was meaningless and confusing to her.
Next door, her uncle snored in his monstrous sleep, which scared her even more. She went out again and set off after the blood. She'd barely understood... A lake of blood and - in the middle of it - her dear Dinu, face up, lying on the ground; Vira screams briefly... and slips beside the boy.
The wind gently caressed their cheeks... It's like a horse... I was pitying these two tormented young men, with their pure souls, true angels.
Light pours over the village. Dinu and Vira are still lying in the snow, and the guards are sleeping soundly, sleeping hard; in the alleys, not a sound. But the wind is blowing even colder; snowflakes rarely fall on the two. The snowflakes woke the girl, who began to show signs of life... She was coming out of her faint. A few moments later she stirred restlessly, opened her eyes wide and jumped up as if on fire! She felt light and strong again... singing, screaming... laughing like never before in her life. Then, grabbing Dinu, she pulled him into the house. She left him there, and again roaring with laughter..., again screaming, singing, then she went out of the house again. She started running, barefoot, through the village... Running towards the church. There she rang the big bell, as if she had set out to gather the whole village - to mourn her dear Dinu...
At the ringing of the bell, the village rang - deserted... Then the silence fell again...
Vira returned home... Singing, laughing... She put on her festive clothes and went out again...
The girl, poor thing, had gone mad.
THEORY AND PRACTICE
"There are some skills you gain just by reading or being talked about. But there are also some that don't sink in until you see them for yourself. While we live - much we hear, and much we see, but yet - nothing we shall know properly until we put our hand to and do what we seem to know. In other words, I mean, theory is good theory, often, but sometimes it falls by the wayside compared to practice."
So said a wise old man once - to young people who had not yet left school, and who had the idea that... no one was as learned as they were, and that... what goes around comes around!
To understand what I have told you so far, consider the beautiful anecdote that the old man told the young people:
Some wise emperor - and a wise man, not a joke - set out to show that sometimes theory alone is not enough, and that a smart man is really smart when, in addition to theory, he has some practice. And so, that he might understand this better, he, the king, placed in the middle of a dining-room eight cubits long, five cubits wide, and four cubits high, a bowl as big as a bowl of sweet pilaf, and brought two spoons, also six cubits long. Then he called the most learned men in the world, and said to them that he would pay them great visits, if they could eat of this pilaf: "Take the spoons as you see them here, but do not turn the bowl away, and do not come near it."
The poor scholars twisted and turned, and, seeing that they could not succeed, told the emperor that what he wanted was impossible.
When the emperor saw this, he called for another man, who did not know much about books, but was very practical and had a good mind for many things. When he found out what the emperor wanted, he said to one of the learned men, without thinking:
- Hey, man, you take one of these spoons and go to the other corner of the room; I'll take another spoon like yours and go to the other corner.
When they had done so, they each lifted the spoon tails into the top corner and then stuck the spoons into the bowl of pilaf. The one with the practice spoon extended the spoon and put it in the mouth of the one with the theory: he filled the spoon and the one with the theory and fed his companion with the practice. And they did so until they were full.
Seeing this, the people gathered there, at the gathering, understood that the one with the theory could not have eaten the pilaf if the one with the practice did not guide and help him.
Practice and theory together -
I always do a good job!
THE FARMER AND THE HEN
A simple villager, as all villagers are, thought what he thought, to go and visit his emperor.
Without asking the doorman, he entered the room where the emperor was eating and sat down at the table. Our villager had brought from home, in a tray, a chicken stuffed with pistachios, raisins, rice and more.
The emperor, who was in a mood that day, said nothing to the villager, but waited to see what the man was going to do.
The peasant took a knife and fork and divided the hen: the head he gave to the king, the wings he gave to his boys, the feet - to the servants, and the full middle he kept for himself, and began to eat.
The emperor could not wait any longer, - and told him that the division of the hen was not fair, because he kept the best part for himself.
- Forgive me, Lord... I did it right. I give you the head because you are our head; to your sons I give the wings, because they are like wings to you, your helper; to your servants I give the feet, because servants do nothing but run up and down. For me, who am a middle man, you stop my middle...
At these words, the emperor laughed out loud, and even gave the villager away.
This act of fun spread throughout the village.
HOW COME THEY'RE NOT GYPSIES
They hated begging like that... Rather than with hands burnt, constantly beating buckets, horseshoes, horseshoes - why shouldn't they heat up their swords, as so many brave men do? And up there in the mountains, with swords on their hips and pistols in their belts - to outwit the robbers on their way, and rob them of their money...
So thought the Gypsy Incense, who had three sons: Cotta, Culaie and White. And neither one nor the other - they got ready, filled their trays with bread and - ran to the mountains; they became a kind of outlaws!
As long as the trawlers remained full of food, they aimed for a thick shadow, as far away from the main road as possible, and there, lying on their bellies, they kept making plans.
Days went by, but the porters didn't show up, because why should they look where they couldn't find their way? The gypsies' food was melting... They were afraid to move. The barking of a dog only - and it made them shiver like a chicken, made their souls freeze. Weird outlaws!
There's nothing left in the gypsy trails! Which one of them will now go down to the village for bread?
- Daddy," said Cotta, "mother said well, we are not made to be outlaws!
- Cotta's right, Daddy," Culaie wades in. We'd better go back to the village and make horses.
White - he didn't say a word.
- It wouldn't hurt, boys, to head back to the valley and surrender. I'm just afraid the bastards will think we've done something wrong.
And just like that, the poor... gypsy-gypsies were in dire straits. But God did not forsake them, and brought them a field of blackberries. By day they dared not eat, but when evening fell - my God!
Three days - they satisfied their hunger, with blackberries only, but they ended up there too. There was no other way but to go to the mill and beg for bread. So they did.
As soon as they got close to the mill, the dog started barking.
- Hey, miller," cried the gypsy incense, "hold your dog, because the haiduci are afraid!
As soon as the dog was tied up, the gypsies entered the mill and asked the miller to bake them a large cake, as hungry as they were, dead hungry. The miller put the cake in the oven, and the brave outlaws waited on their bellies...
But soon the mill was besieged by the beasts, because its master had called them in secret.
- Get out of the way, the miller hissed, the raiders are coming!
One of the gypsies, the father, never got a chance to hide. They caught him and cut him up.
- Breee, what black blood these gypsies have!" said a gypsy. As their skin is, so is their blood...
- Not so, Your Highness," cried Cotta, hiding somewhere and trembling like a cabbage: the blood is black as blackberries.
They caught this one too - and slit his throat.
- If he had been silent, he would still be alive," said a jay.
- Why did you talk, you fool? - Cola shouted at him.
They also caught Cola and cut him up.
The white man, who was still alive, said - wisely:
- I'll shut up, Mr. Jandar. Just let me...
- And you, crow, are you... a thug?
They seized him too and sent him to the other world.
And - since then, there are no more Gypsy Gypsies.
WHY SHEPHERDS STEAL
When they brought Christ to crucify Him on the cross, His enemies asked for a few spikes. And as soon as the spikes arrived, a shepherd came by. The shepherd's heart was broken when he saw Jesus suffering. What was he to do? He twisted and turned, and the spikes, who knows how, made legs from there.
The enemies of the Saviour, when they saw that the spikes were no more, raged with rage. They look up, they look down, - no one and nothing, and the spikes - nowhere. "Well, well! They've gone into the ground!" - so they all said to each other in astonishment, none of them being able to explain. (The shepherd, by the way, had washed the well away, nobody's fool.)
In between, there's a milkmaid. He had learned from one or another that there was a need for spikes here:
- That's the trouble? - he asked after being told that the spikes had vanished, as if bewitched. If that's all it is, stop poisoning your soul, and I'll make you bigger and better ones!
And the gypsy went and made some spikes, gypsy spikes, as it were, which, when they were beaten into the body of Christ, suffered, poor thing, the passion of the world.
Then Jesus turned to the shepherd and said:
- Shepherd, you who loved me, blessed be you! May I see you always clothed and satiated, and stealing - may you not give in, nor have trouble from it.
Then, turning to the milkman, you also served him:
- You bitter gypsy! May you never have any luck, and may you always walk around with your ass in a sling, shaggy and cursed!
And look, from that event, since then, since long ago, the Gypsy people, also called the people of Christ, is the cause of all evils. And the shepherd - even since then, no matter how good and happy he may be, cannot help falling, now and then, into the sin the Saviour has given him: he steals, that is, at least one noaten a year.
OF NASTRATIN-HOGEA'S
There were once three travellers. One day, they were caught in a storm on the way, and they turned up at a local inn they had just left behind. They stayed up all night, with good food and drink, and at dawn they asked the innkeeper to prepare something for the journey. But as the innkeeper had no cooked food at that time, he boiled them about ten eggs. They counted their sleeping, food and drink, hay for the horses - and the innkeeper, and they forgot all about the eggs.
It must have been three years since then. And so it came to pass that the three travellers took another shot at their old innkeeper. One of them, wanting to know how honest he was, called the innkeeper and said:
- Hey, Dimache - that was the man's name - three years ago, my friends and I came to your place. We were here, but we forgot to pay you ten eggs, which you boiled for the journey. They all cost one franc. Look, we'll give you two now. Are you satisfied?
- I remember the story well - my dear guest, the innkeeper returned it, only... you're a bit stingy with the payment. Today, three years later, I'm owed a thousand francs for ten eggs!
- That's a good one!" said the travellers, astonished. You're laughing at us, innkeeper...
- I'm not laughing at all. A thousand francs! Otherwise, we'll end up in court.
The travellers did not take their leave, and the innkeeper called them before the judge.
The next day they received their summonses, and at about nine o'clock - here they are before the judge. And the innkeeper, after telling how the travellers had come to him, and how he had made them eat, came to the eggs.
- Ten eggs - he points out - would have given me as many chicks. Each of them would have brought me, the following summer, another ten chicks, so that would have made a hundred heads. The other summer, the hundred chicks would have reached a thousand! All I ask of these travelers, Your Honor, is a franc of chickens. But advise them to give me a thousand francs sooner, otherwise I'll change my mind and ask for more!
The judge fell into thought, seeming, from the look on his face, to be about to agree with the innkeeper.
One of the travellers pretends to have a bloody nose. So he gets out and - shotgun, goes after the lawyer.
At that time, Nastratin-Hogea was the most famous lawyer there. When he got to him, the emperor told him the whole story.
- Very well, said Nastratin. Go back to the court and tell the judge that you, thinking his sentence unjust, have called a lawyer to defend you, and that I am coming.
The traveller returns to the courthouse and tells the judge how Nastratin had taught him. The judge knew Nastratin well, so what to do, he waited for him.
And he waits an hour, he waits two hours, but Nastratin, nowhere. The judge losing patience, he sends a bailiff after him to summon him. When the bailiff came to Nastratin, he found him boiling wheat. He told him he was expected at the court and to hurry. Nastratin told him that he would come at once, that the wheat was ready, boiled, and then it grew like water. The poor bailiff, at such a racket - I don't know how he can bow in wonder!
But the bailiff ran to the judge and told what his ears had heard. The judge, what to do - he laughed too!
Finally, here's Nastratin at the courthouse.
- Why are you keeping us waiting, Mr. Nastratin?" the judge asked.
- My sins, your highness, I had some wheat to boil, I couldn't leave it on the fire, because I was in a hurry to send it to the field, to put it in the ground, so - boiled, it grows better and taller.
"Ha, ha, ha!" - everyone in the room started laughing.
- Ptiu! Woe betide you, you fool!" burst out the judge. Where did you say boiled wheat grows?
- But did boiled eggs ever produce chicken? - Nastratin-Hogea turned to her, smiling. Laugh at me - and don't forget how foolish you are, you who are supposedly called to share justice!...
And that's how our lawyer saved the poor travellers from the trouble they had got into.
The innkeeper, nose to the grindstone, wandered home, and great if he didn't kick his wife's ass, because it went so badly for him!
A CLEVER VIZIER
The Shah of Persia has long desired to know how many fools he has in his kingdom, and he had one of his vizirs draw up a list of them. The Vizier drew up the list, but he found the Shah in the head of it! When the Shah saw such a thing, fire was kindled!
- Your Highness," said the vizier, "don't be angry. The other day you gave a lot of money to some people to go and buy horses from Europe, and I'm sure they won't come back with either the money or the horses. See why I put you at the top of the list of fools?
- What if they come back? - Chess asked.
- If they come back, I'll erase Your Majesty's name and pass only theirs, said the vizier.
HOW THE RAT GOT CAUGHT
A poor man once had a very good vineyard, a vineyard from which he also fed his family. His neighbour - a man of substance, no joke - envied him for this vineyard, and eventually took it away from him, with a yelp, of course. The victim went to complain to the judge about such an injustice. Then the man of the law called the rich man to him and said:
- Why were you taking the neighbor's vineyard?
- The life is mine," said the rich man.
- Do you have witnesses that it's yours? - asked the judge.
- He even confesses it's mine - he turned it over to her.
- Don't you remember? - the judge is surprised. Where did you see him live - to speak?
- Don't get upset, ladies. Let's go over there, and we'll see that this vine is talking.
At night, the rich man took his son, dressed him in a samurai's robe, like the son of a good man that he was, and went with him to the vineyard. He dug a sort of a crook there, and put his son inside, saying to him, "Tomorrow at eight o'clock, when we arrive here, and we will ask: "Whose vineyard are you?" - you shall answer, "I am the rich man's!" And so the next day - as they had spoken - they went to the vineyard to ask her. They asked her, and she answered, "I am the rich man's!" Thus the rich man took possession of the vineyard on which he had set his eyes.
The poor poor man, grieved greatly at this injustice, cursed, saying:
- Let him that speaketh be doomed to walk upon the earth for ever and ever, and let him that speaketh see no light.
And since then, the rich man's son became a rat.
CIOCÂRLANUL
The woodpecker was first a proud young shepherd boy. Listen - so you know - how he became a bird.
When his moustache began to tingle, and his heart to beat for the girls, as the whistle sounded in the spring, when the meadows were green, you know how it is when the herds of the Armenians are grazing up the beautiful mountain slopes, then he became a shepherd.
He became a shepherd, but his flock was grazed more by Viroana - his bitch - than by himself, who was always chasing sparrows' nests and coon's eyes. Otherwise he was a good boy, he wouldn't have taken from anyone - not a penny! He was a man of justice.
As he sat in the shade one day and blew his whistle, a sweet, sweet little whistle - you can't get enough of it - could be heard from somewhere in the bushes of the forest.
The shepherd couldn't get the song out of his mind and he loved the bird so much that he decided to catch it.
With this thought in his foolish mind, he left his flock in the care of no one, and set off through the woods after the bird in question.
He kept on catching it, he thought, but the bird, of - it wasn't blind! No sooner had our shepherd boy reached the trunk of the tree in which it was singing - and he kept telling it, like a mother of fire - that it flew away to another tree, and started singing again, as before.
The shepherd boy was always left with swollen lips. He figured out where the bird was sitting, and - run there!
For three days and three nights the beautiful shepherd boy ran with his tongue out after the wonder of the bird. And when at last he saw himself under the boughs of the tree from which the song was heard, he leaned for a moment on the trunk, and, weary and broken as he was, - to which he was joined and unheard by the sweet voice of the bird, which seemed to anoint his heart with honey, - he fell into a deep and heavy sleep, so that he seemed not to breathe, you would have thought he was dead for good.
He slept, in this oblivion of his, for three years - and perhaps he would not have woken, had not the tree collapsed, rotting under his weight.
Once awake, he rubs his eyes and looks carefully to see where his golden bird has flown. He imagined that sleep had only stolen him for a moment.
When he looked around and didn't see it, he wanted to punch himself in the head, because he could have ducked and let the bird escape.
As if beaten by hail he turned back to the herd, but all the time he couldn't get it out of his head - "how could he have missed them..."
When he reached the place where he had left his flock, he was astonished to see that his sheep were now more numerous than before. He called his bitch and learned from her that... he had been missing for three years! Let's beggars can't be choosers! He thought he'd only closed his eyes - and when he did - three years' sleep! Cross your heart!
Finally! He was glad to be alive again anyway and... cheers!
And, just when he was praising his dogs and sheep, here is the master Nicola - the wolf - who begs him to the ground, worshipping him, to give him a sheep, because he didn't do him any damage, while he was missing. The shepherd was a good shepherd, and was glad to find his flock increased: "Here," he said to the wolf, "take a ram and go with God!"
The vixen poisoned herself so much for this meaningless gift that if a bullet had pierced her, not a drop of blood would have flowed from her. What did she say to herself? "The wolf did no harm to the flock, because I guarded it. And my master - to give him our first ram?" Poor Viroana - she couldn't forget such a thing!
That's why the bitch took her good day from the herd and went away.
In the morning, when the shepherd gets up at dawn and calls her to feed him - take her from where she is not! He calls her again, and again... Viroana, no trace! She's gone and that's that!... The shepherd boy was so upset, you'd think all his ships had drowned. He looked for her, but where didn't he look? He turned the land the other way, but he still couldn't find Viroana.
Dejected, so upset that he wanted to die, he didn't know what to do. It was as if he had become half a man. It was only then that he realised what a foolish thing he had done: to give the wolf the very ram he had been holding! He was running around with it, but it was no use, it was late now. In this state, he said, eyes to heaven, praying:
Oh, my God,
Put wings on me, like a kite -
Give me another crest,
Right here on the skull -
Make me a bird with a beak,
Let's get her out of here fast,
To catch my Viroana -
That much is hard without it!
And God, it seems, heard him! He listened to his prayer and made him a bird: the zebra now gave him wings, and the hood - a kind of crest, which is still called a shepherd. In the mornings you can hear him calling from one sky to another, calling his bitch, bouncing up and down in the sky... But he never found her, poor shepherd boy, he's still a bird today.
The Armenians distinguish in his singing something, a whistle, like a call somehow:
Cut-cut, cut-cut!
My Vir Viroana,
My Vir Viroana!
Shepherds call their dogs the same way when they lose them, or when they feed them.
That he was a shepherd, that's what the hood on his head shows. You may ask, how come the shepherd was wearing the hood just as he became a bird? Well, you will know that the poor thing ran so much that he was caught in the autumn rains, that there was no way, in such weather, to walk uncovered. And what else..., what else can I tell you, so I've heard, so I've told you.
That was it, with the shepherd boy, poor thing.
THE-BEAUTIFUL-BOY-HUNTER
He was once a famous hunter! He was poor and poorly educated, but he wouldn't give up hunting. From dawn till dusk, always with his rifle in his sights - through the woods and mountains! He only shot at the target, a great thing! He didn't miss a cartridge - no matter how far away the game was: he took it to the trap and hit it, no matter what!
He and his wife, because he was married, had a son.
- Man, said the woman, leave him alone hunting and see if you can get something else! Can't you see what a mess we're in?
But in vain! What, like he ever paid any attention to her?
It was only when he fell ill in a row, and was about to leave this world, that he understood that he had wasted his life for nothing. And he also understood that no one can be caught from game. That's why he wished that at least his little son, who was still young, would not follow in his footsteps.
As I was saying, the hunter felt that he was going to leave our world, because the rope was too tight around his neck, and he called his wife to him and said:
- Listen, woman! I - I did what I did, and no more life, I got to the end of it, the hard way. But beware - our little son does not follow in my footsteps. You see, as soon as I close my eyes, gather up all the rifles and pistols, and hide them in a snake-hole, lest this little fellow should stumble over them and, God forbid, become a hunter himself!
He said these words and walked away - forever.
They buried him as best they could, like the bereaved people they were.
The wife, after weeping and mourning him enough, remembered what her man had told her, and forced herself to give her son to learn some trade, good or bad - trade it may be! "As long as he doesn't starve to death," she thought, "and I don't see him walking around with a rifle. A trade is a golden bracelet, who doesn't live by it?"
But his son-in-law - that's all he dreamed about, because he didn't remember his job. He looked like his aunt... Oh! So he could fall, if not near the hairline? Well - to the rifles, to a few swords - and to roam the forests and mountains! He didn't have flour in the barn at home - he didn't have a bad heart for that.
One day, having nothing to do, he asks his mother:
- Mom, what was my father bragging about?
The woman didn't really want to tell him, because she saw him as a bit unworthy, but if he stayed and stayed and stayed, he wouldn't give her any more peace, she hated him and told him:
- Your father was a hunter.
- Great! Now, give me his rifles quick, so I can go hunting.
Her poor mother didn't know how to get these weevils out of her head. But he - like a stubborn donkey, he kept saying: "Rifles - and that's it!"
Get your eyes out! It happened to him. She got sick of his persistence, gave him the rifles, and - his job!
The little boy took them, took care of them nicely, and, haindem, to the hunt!
He didn't walk too far when - lo and behold - he spots a beautiful bird-fire in a tree. He takes it in his sights, shoots and shoots it, as if he thought he was a hunter! And from then on, he decided to hunt all his life.
One day, he goes out hunting with several of his friends.
They went where they went, and they went over valleys and forests and heavy mountains, but they did not come across game. Towards evening, they found themselves in the Black Forest.
It was known from olden times that no one had ever walked in this forest. No man had dared to enter it, for it was guarded by a dragon, who, when he found out that someone had entered it, would fly out of his palaces and swallow him! But the boy was not one of those who return empty from the hunt. He said to his companions:
- I go into the woods, maybe find some game, and - whatever! I didn't come back empty-handed, and I never will.
The others tried hard to put it out of his mind, to leave the Black Forest, that it was bad; but, in one ear went this advice and out the other.
When his friends saw that there was no face with him, they returned to the village alone.
The handsome hunter's-son, our little boy in the story, also, without fear, plunged into the Black Forest!
No sooner had he taken two steps than he suddenly saw a bear the size of a buffalo, which was so terrifying to look at. The handsome hunter's-son shot, hit him in the heart and put him down!
Except that the rifle's roar could be heard all the way to the dragon in the palace. The dragon sprang out, to see what kind of two-headed creature was trampling on his place, and howled from his crouch:
- Hey-hey! Who are you to come here?!
- Here I am!" said the handsome hunter.
He loads his rifle again, and shoots again, this time at the dragon!
But he was shooting in vain: he was wasting his gunpowder! The bullet hit that plow and slid down. The bullets couldn't penetrate the dragon's skin, it's not soft. You can't prove these guys with a shell!
He shot the boy again, and again, and again - until he had no more bullets, but the dragon remained unmoved!
- Now, said the dragon, what do you want me to do to you?
- You can swallow me," replied the son.
- To this day, no one has dared to trample my estate. You're the only one, my boy, and you seem brave to me, - Whose will you be, that you dare to shoot at me?!
- I'm a hunter's boy in a dress!
- If so - na, I forgive you, I won't eat you - said the dragon. I know your father, God forgive him! That's why you're allowed to come here whenever your heart desires.
The boy was having a hard time coming to his senses! But he rejoiced at the words of the dragon! Then he skinned the bear, took the fur with him and went home.
Here, in the village, no one expected to see him again, and now they didn't know how to praise him for his feat of unprecedented bravery.
They instructed the boy to take the bear's fur as a gift to the king, for he would surely be rewarded with a great reward. He did so, and went straight to the king's palace with the fur.
At the palace gate the vizier greets him. The latter, seeing how beautiful the fur was, wanted to give it to the king. And he said to the son:
- Hey, boy, aren't you going to sell me this fur?
- I'm not selling it," said the little boy. It's a fish for our king.
So he did, and gave it to the king, who filled his pockets with coins. Then he called his vizier:
- Look, you see?" he said: "You've been eating my bread for years and years, but so far I haven't seen a single morsel from you, to remind me! As long as this son, a stranger to this day - look what a wonderful plocon he brought me!
The Vizier was deeply grieved at this, and from that hour he bore his son's wrath, who had humiliated him before the king. He would have done all he could to have him put away. He even began to make some sort of a move on the king. He said then and there:
- Yes, my God, but if you had the Bluebird - no one else in the world would be like you.
- I'd love to, but where do I get it? the cricket cried.
- The handsome son-of-a-hunter would bring it to you at once!
He called the son, and commanded the king:
- Listen to this! You, who brought me the bear's fur, get me, as you know, the Bluebird, or I'll hang you and not another!
The little boy returns home, his head bowed, in a bad mood. Why should he take this bird? If he thought what he thought, his mind ached with thought, what was he thinking? "Let me go to the dragon! Maybe this one knows where the big birds roam."
On the road again, go on, and here's the handsome-son-of-a-hunter to the dragon. He tells him what ails him: so-and-so asks the king: and if he won't listen, bring him the Bluebird, he'll hang him!
- Are you that scared? Don't worry! It's the easiest thing I've ever heard of. Here's how you do it: you take two cans - one you fill with ashes to hide in, and the other - with water. You put them by the sea. The birds will come and fly away, and after that they'll get into your box and roll around in the ashes. So you reach out, grab one of them, and good luck!
The handsome hunter-boy did as the dragon taught him. He went with his boxes to the edge of the sea. Before long, a cloud of great birds, all golden! They drank their fill of the water, and then they wanted to bathe in the ashes. And the little boy, with his paw, and catch one!
- Lord, great and mighty art thou, but none could beat thee, if thou hadst the Beauty of the World!
- Do you know anyone who can bring it to me?
- Who else, if not the handsome-son-of-a-hunter?
And he sends for the king, and says to him:
- Do what you know, and bring me the Beauty of the World, if you don't want me to hang you! I don't say much!
The boy - flees, again, to the dragon! The dragon, who was no longer out of his sight, teaches him what and how to do, to track down Beauty of the World.
This boy made himself a pair of iron shoes, took with him a rod also of iron to lean on, worshipped the icon, and set out for the Beautiful World.
He walked, and walked, for a whole day. When the sun went down, he saw under a tree two buffaloes that someone had just roasted in two roasters. Before the boy approached, the man who was twirling the skewers over the fire - he swallowed them, as if they had never been!
"Man, eat him," said the boy to himself, "what kind of a man is this! Let me see him up close."
He comes closer and speaks to her:
- Good weather, baby!
- Live, my niece.
With that, the jerk stretched as long as he could, and sighed:
- Of! I could have used a couple more buffaloes! I've had enough!
- You're a great guy if you can swallow that much!
- I'm nothing compared to the son of a hunter who caught the Bluebird!
- Well, that's me.
- You? Then - take me along, comrade...
- Of course I'll take you!
And they were made to lie down, and they set out together on the road to the Beauty of the World.
And they walked, and they walked, and behold, far away, a man carrying millstones, walking from mountain to mountain! Dunes and hills - they were nothing to him. He flew over them like a bird in flight, not even touching them. By the time they'd got a good look at him, the giant had reached him.
- Don't mind me, but you're great, man," said the handsome hunter-boy! Weighed down with millstones, and you run like that? I've never heard or seen anything like it!
- What do you know? I may be great, but I'm not ashamed of the handsome hunter-boy who could catch the Bluebird! That man!
- If you saw him, would you go with him?
- Listen to you! Any more talk?
- Well, that's me. Come with us!
And they made themselves into a bunch of monsters: the handsome hunter's-son, the Pope-all, and the giant Road-Eater. And go again... Only Road-Eater was not accustomed to walk like a snail: and he took his two companions on his back, and then he walked, as he knew how. And so, in one day - they had made a year's journey!
When they were just crossing a lake, I see a man lying on the ground, as if he was asleep. The little boy - he calls out to him:
- Hey, buddy - what are you doing there?
- Well, what do I do? I eavesdrop on the dead and the sleeping.
- Great wonder! But you don't have a partner in the world, if that's what you mean.
- I have and I don't have a pair, said Aude-tot - that's what he called this one. I'm nothing compared to the handsome hunter's son!
- Would you go with him if he got in your way?
- How could you not go with a famous man like him?
- Well, that man is me...
He took his son and Aude-tot with him, and they were now the fârtats - four in number, four men without equal - and, come on, move on!
In the evening, here they are, they come across a river. There, what can you see? A thing never seen before: someone was sitting on the other side of the river, sipping all the water as it came downstream! He sipped it and let it out again. The man was a river-drinker!
- What are you up to, man? - asked the handsome hunter-boy.
- Here, I'll play like this, to pass the time, I still have no work.
The boy is also behaving with this one - and the others. And he made him a companion too. Then the five of them went on their way, also to the Beautiful World. They were about a day's journey from there. Towards evening, they dismounted, to sleep in an edge of the forest where it was dark.
As he sits, the little boy, lying on his back, he hears I don't know what a big wail. He goes to see what it is. What had happened? They were quarrelling, ready to tear each other apart, an eagle, a wasp and an ant. They'd just run into a lion, and they couldn't get along. The boy managed to get them out of it: he gave the eagle the lion's share, and the wasp and the ant took some of the blood, and thanked the tuscans. The creatures mentioned were in his debt. So the eagle plucked out a feather, gave it to his son and said:
- Whenever you're in trouble, I'll come to your rescue. Just light it!
Then the wasp and the ant did the same. The little boy tucked his feathers into his breast and went to bed with his companions.
The next day - here they are at Beauty of the World! The boy stopped in front of the girl's mother, and told her that he came on behalf of the village's king, who wanted Beauty for his bride.
- Very well!" said the old woman, "I'll give you the girl, but you find out, my boy, that you won't take my daughter lightly! Let me see some brave deeds first, from your king's envoys!
Said the little boy, then:
- And what kind of facts do you expect from us?
- Look: here I have a giant eating twenty ovens of bread - quick, quick! Is there one like that among your people?
- Let's see, said the little boy! I'll give you an answer, let me just see...
He was thinking of the Pope-all, who swallowed and swallowed and couldn't get enough. And he says to this one:
- Did you hear what the girl's mother wants from us? Think you can handle it? That's twenty ovens of bread, no joke!
- Only twenty?" cries the Pope-all. Why not forty?
And he took the footie to the girl's mother. And when this one started - and his jaws went: "Shut up, shut up, shut up!" - the loaves of bread disappeared like nothing, as if they had never been! Twenty ovens of bread - and he still couldn't get enough of it! Bottomless sack!
- You don't have any more? - he asked, as he finished what they had given him.
Seeing that the mother of the beautiful world can't make it with this hunger, she thinks up something else:
- Look at me! You've done that too, but here's another test: a month's walk from here, there's a fountain of golden water. My giant makes this journey in one day. If you have someone to keep up with him, I'll give you the girl, if not - be well!
- How could I not? - the boy said.
He got into his horde Road-Eater, who ran like the wind, even faster!
They set off at once - the two of them, and - in the blink of an eye, the Road-Eater was at the well! He filled his bowl with golden water, took two giant steps back - and found himself halfway there. What did the man say to himself? "I'll take a nap, my brother - because there's more to come before that one comes! And then, even if he passes me, I'll catch up and leave him behind!" He goes to sleep, but he falls asleep.
And the son-in-law is waiting for the Swallower, waiting for him - but this one, nothing! The boy falls into thought - what about his companion? Where is he, cutting leaves for the dogs, that he's taking so long, he didn't need more than an hour to go and come back!
And he says to Aude-tot:
- You pinch your ear and see - what's with the Swallow-road!
Aude-tot, who heard the dead and the sleeping talking, stretched himself out on the ground as long as he could, pressed his ear to the ground, and immediately heard the snoring of the Road-Eater.
- My God, my God - what a ticker this one is pulling! Put it out, not another one!
Then the handsome-boy-hunter calls the river-breather, who was playing at sipping water, and then he splashes it again:
- Hey, bitch, you think you can wake him up?
- Just wait and see how he jumps like he's burned!
On the spot - he siphoned a whole river to its headwaters, and then splashed it all over the Road-Eater, making it a mess! The swallow-tailed man, shivering in the cold water, sprang to his feet, just as if burned! He looked for the pot of golden water - the pot was lying somewhere overturned, the man had spilled it on the girl's mummy, when he too had passed the well. What was to be done now? Back to the well! When he got there again, the other - he had just arrived too, exhausted, pity him! His sweat was pouring - down the river!
The swallower-road wasted no time now; one foot on one mountain-top, the other on another, and there he was in the village of the Beautiful-World, four or five hours ahead of the other - who had not rested at all, anywhere. He had left him by the wagon!
And this time the handsome hunter-boy wins! Pretty's mother saw that it's no game and that this boy is no commoner. She had to give him the girl now, according to their agreement, but it wasn't easy. How could he part with her and give her away so far? That's why he was trying to think of something - so that the son couldn't fulfil his promise, and so the daughter would remain. And she gave him another one:
 Otherwise you won't see my daughter.
The boy asks the Road-Eater if he knows of this living, life-giving water. But no - he didn't know! That's why he's sitting there now, racking his head: where can he find it? "Whoops!" flashed through the boy's mind, "the eagle, like a bird that flies everywhere, might know!" Light him the eagle's feather, and - just long enough to twist once - yank it!
- Command, my God!
He tells his son what he is and if he can bring him life-giving water without death.
But even he had never heard of such water!
- I do not know, my lord, nor have I heard of it; it is but a week since I had a chick fledged: should I have known, or even heard of such water-would I not turn the earth over for it? And my little darling was not dying!
- Look for it, please, for me, now! - the son asked.
The eagle soared like a rifle into the clouds, and from there - watch the wheel, all the way. Somewhere, far, far away, he sees a bird with a warbler in its beak. He swoops down on it, grabs it, takes the deadly, living water from the urchin, and brings it to the boy.
That bird belonged to the Beauty of the World mummy. If he managed to return home to his mistress, the child would lose his bet and give up! Only the eagle had broken a wing when it swooped down on her, and the bird now had to return on foot, not in flight, so it was very late! He came after the handsome huntsman's son, so that he could slap the girl's mother! That's right. What's she going to do now? Because, look, it didn't suit this boy! But she still found something - and said:
- I'll give you one more try. After that, I won't ask you anything, you take your daughter and go - long live!
- S-au-zon! God willing, maybe I can. What's this all about?
- I have a barn full of wheat, and tares, and millet, and barley, and many other things. I want - by tomorrow - you to pick them each by variety, wheat aside, millet, barley - the same, and whatnot.
The boy didn't say - no! He's lighting the ant feather now, and - there you go - this little ant has shown itself to him!
- You summoned me, benefactor? Has the time come for me to repay you for the good you've done me?
The boy told her what he wanted from her.
- Well, that's nothing. There's nothing easier for my people to do," said the ant. Then she called her ant-friends, and, dividing their work among themselves, until dawn - everything was chosen by seed, especially.
- I did that too," said the boy, "now what do you want? Girl!
- All right, said the woman, go and get her, but take note: there are forty girls with her! All of them beautiful, and all of them like drops of water. If you can tell the beauty of the world apart - yours be!
The boy laughed under his whiskers at the old woman's cunning. He also lit the wasp's feather, and when the wasp arrived, she found out what was required of her.
- Don't worry!" he said, "I know the Beauty of the World. When you go into the girls' room, I'll pinch her right ear. You, be careful, that's all - just watch your eyes: the girl who puts her hand to her ear to defend herself - she's the Beauty of the World! Take her by the hand and go home with her!
The boy listened to what the wasp was telling him and went into the room of the forty girls. There, he looked at them all in turn. They were beautiful, my God! But how could he tell, alone, which was the Beauty of the World? That they were all - like the moon and the stars! You should have searched from sunrise to sunset, all over the world - and you would not have found them. They were like forty lightning bugs!
The boy looked at them, dumbfounded - ready to lose his mind!
He suddenly sees that one of the girls keeps rubbing her ear. And he realizes she's the belle of the world. He takes her hand! She's still going strong!
What should the girl's mother do? That's how it had been written to Beauty of the World, to marry far away. He kissed her on both cheeks, kissed the son on the forehead, and then said to them both, in a sweet voice and with tears in his eyes:
- Well, go with God, but! And be happy, my dears!
The beautiful woman of the world, on her departure, asks her mother to allow her to take her giant with her, and to take the water-life, the one without death. The old woman, who was very fond of these enchanted things, had no choice but to give them to him, so as not to spoil the girl's joy.
The young people then arrived, God willing, in the village of the Beautiful-son-of-the-hunter.
The boy, who had noticed how much he loved Beauty of the World, stopped his daughter for him, and did not want to give her to the king. Only he knew what had happened to him before he won her - and now he's going to leave her to the landlord, like a damsel? No way!
The king learns that the handsome-son-of-a-hunter is marrying the girl - and, fire it is done! He sends his men to kill him. These men catch him, and kill him, they've cut him to bits!
- What are you standing around looking at these? And you, big guy - why did your mother stop you? Get them!
The handsome hunter-boy rushed to the men of the crane, threw himself upon them and the giant, and began to slaughter them! And the giant cuts at them, and swallows, and cuts and swallows them again - swallows them with all their clothes and all their weapons - until there's not one left! Then the giant went to the palace. There - he did the same. He cut them down and swallowed them whole, with their very crest.
And so, the queen was left without a king. Then the son-in-law - like a brave man without a match - ascended the throne and made himself king, and the Beauty of the World made herself queen - and they lived, reign!
And I found myself there, where I brought for each one - either a belt, a skirt, or a pair of new felt skirts. But just as I was crossing the ford to enter the village, the dogs smelled me, and - ham-ham, ham-ham, they jumped at me, because - the shoes seemed to them to be a bit like liver, the belt - a sort of mace, and the skirt - a belly. And gophers! One here, gophers! another from the other side - so much did they pull at them, that they finally made a mess of them!
CLEVER OLD MAN'S DAUGHTER
It was, what wasn't.
The thing of wonder was, everywhere it was said, all ears pricked and amazed.
Once upon a time, my brother, there lived an emperor.
This emperor also had a vizier. Who knows why, the emperor - only gave the vizier hard work to do. One day - it was around noon - what was going through his mind? He called his vizier, and he came and said:
- Visire, my son - you take this yellow, and buy me a yellow, a soft velvet, which costs even a yellow, and then buy me a ram, also a yellow, and... and bring me back the yellow!
"Ptiu!, eat him!" said the vizier to himself, "kill him with a drum! Well, can it be so - and meaty, and milky, and early-rising?"
- Listen, my son," added the Emperor, "you have a year of thinking and working from me. If you don't succeed, he will drink your water! Do you understand me?
- Understood, your highness! ("And sheep, sheep - lest any of them be missing! - and the wolf fed, that's what!")
The Wazir went away, with his head down as if his ships had drowned; but he did not weep for the trouble that had come upon him. And he went about, and went about, to find someone to advise him to get it out of his head somehow. In his travels, he met an old man. "Hello!" one, "Good to your heart!" the other - and they set off together towards a village just in sight.
The stinker had arrived in its prime. And he calls the vizier to the old man, who is silent, as if speechless;
- Old man, why don't you pick me up, and then I'll pick you up too, that's the only way we'll make it in this heat!
The old man looked at him, and said to himself: "That's in a sack, God forgive me! Hear, word - I'll take it on my back, here, on the hill, and on this fire!"
They kept talking and arrived in the village, where the old man invited the vizier to his house. The man only had one daughter, but - very clever.
The girl asked her aunt, what kind of man is this guest?
- I don't know what kind of man he is," said the old man, "but it seems to me, poor fellow, that he's only in three doages, if not one!
- How so?
- Well, you'll see what nonsense he told me on the way: that I'd pick him up, and then he'd pick me up too, so that we'd go up the hill... easier!
- Aaaa! My daddy, your guest isn't stupid at all, if he spoke to you like that. No, he's got a headache, no kidding! He meant that the road is easier - when you say one thing and another, you know?
It goes on and on, and the vizier, seeing that the old man's daughter was limping, said, while chatting with the old man:
- Nice house, but it has a crooked chimney.
The old man's eyes widened in wonder and he said to himself again, "Woe to him! Whatever my daughter says, he's not in his right mind!"
The girl just then entered the bedroom. She heard the stranger speak as he had spoken, and answered him:
- The chimney may be crooked, but the smoke goes straight up!
Then go out of the house, prepare food and honor your guest.
- Clever girl you have, old man," said the vizier.
- Thank God!" replied the old man. She is the joy and comfort of my old age!
And while they were still talking, the old man brought up a rich man who had died that day from his village.
- Did he die alive, or did he die dead? asked the vizier.
The old man looked at him again, and thought, "There's no telling, he's a fool!" Then he crossed over, and said to him:
- No offense, my girl, but our guest isn't quite himself. Listen to the gossip that comes out of his mouth: "Nice house, but the chimney's crooked!" he says. And only - straighter than our chimney have you ever seen?
- You nut, he's got something else in mind! Where he saw me limping, he thinks I'm a cripple somehow, not knowing I'm getting a nail in my heel. But you saw how I answered him!
- Here, let's say you're right here, my girl. But you'll see - another word for stupid, with him! I was just mentioning the dead man who buried him today, and - you know what he asked me? If he "died... alive, or died... dead!" What do you have to say now? Doesn't this one have a mind?
- Wrong again, my father! The traveller means: did he leave children after him, he who dies, to bear his name, or did he not? for if he left no descendants, he is dead for ever; and if he did, then he is dead alive!
The Vizier, like one who seeks a cure, eavesdropped behind the door, and heard what the two were talking, the father and his daughter.
They made them eat. The girl had prepared a chicken for the table. She brought the bird and divided it like this: she gave the old man the head, the legs she gave to the guest, and for herself she stopped her wings.
The guest, an open-minded man, didn't quite understand why this division. So he asked, to which the girl replied:
- The head belongs to my father, for he is the head of our house; the feet I gave you, stranger, for you need them on the road; and my wings I have kept, for we girls are like birds: as soon as we are given wings, we fly and make a new home.
The Vizier, now, could no longer for the sake of this girl, so clever.
- You, who know so much, he said, maybe you can give me some advice, because look, so and so... And he told her that with only a yellow, she had to get a soft velvet, a ram, and - and the yellow!
- Big deal!" said the girl. Go and buy from the herdsmen an untrimmed ram, with the yolk; then shear the rams, and give the wool to me, and I'll weave you two sails - let him think of them who sees them; one you sell for a yolk and the other you keep. And so you shall have the fleece, and the ramkins, and the yellow, as you were commanded!
The Vizier, hearing her teach him, stared at her in awe! She did so, and - behold, to the emperor!
The emperor could not believe that the vizier was capable of so much. That's why he forced him to tell him the truth, i.e. who advised him. To tell him, that he would do him and the others no harm. The Vizier confessed everything.
This emperor was a young man, and learning of the cleverness of the old man's daughter, he asked her to marry him. They were married, they got married, but - not long after, war broke out, and he had to go and fight.
What do you think he's up to in there? He writes a letter to his woman and orders her like this:
First: to take out of the money-box, sealed in iron, as many gold coins as she wants, without spoiling the seal; second: to stay heavy with him, in his absence, and third: her mare to have a foal with his horse.
Have you seen a woman give up? She didn't even bother! She cut her hair short, dressed herself in men's clothes - without anyone noticing, and then went off to war with a new army, - supposedly to help her husband. (Of course, under a foreign name, for it never occurred to the Emperor who she was!)
Her camp was next to his, and when they weren't fighting the enemy, the woman spent her time in the king's tent.
One evening they played cards, and decided that whoever wins - take the other's seal and do what they want with it. The girl, who knew all these games, beat the emperor! Then, having his seal, she opened the money box and took from it as much money as she wanted.
The other night they played on a girl.
The empress, the damned - she let herself be beaten this time, and later - she dressed herself in women's clothes and went to the emperor, as had been the remnant... To him - it didn't even occur to him that the woman could be his wife!
Another evening they got it - whoever won it from them - to take that other horse, and ride him three days in a row. The Empress, - is there more talk? - proved the emperor, took the horse from him, and led him home to her mare, to catch foal with him. Then she stayed at home, and let the horse go and returned to his master.
So the war was finally cooked, and the emperor, as red in the face as a royal apple, came home.
The first question to his wife, as he saw her, was:
- With my commandments, how did you do it?
- I did what you told me, you men! - she replied with a smile.
The emperor, noticing that the empress has a big belly, turns pale. What did he think? "This wench has taken my commandments for granted, and she must be heavy with someone. Woe betide her! She has no idea, it's her doom now!"
So thought the emperor... But when he heard from her - what and how she had done it all - he put a stone in his mouth and kept quiet. And he even came down from his throne, and went up to her - and everyone loved her beyond words, and would have sworn by her name. They all went to her for advice, and I went to ask her what and how, and she told me the story, and I told it to you, as I knew how!
VAMPIRE
It was what I didn't see! If it hadn't been, it wouldn't have been told.
There was once a bachelor with his wife. They had many children - a dozen or so, but among them - God had not given them a daughter. And how much they wanted a girl! It was their greatest desire. At night, when they went to bed, they would pray to God, "Oh, God, won't you give us a girl?"
Day after day, they woke up with this word on their lips: "Alas! My God, can't you give us a girl?"
Praying like that, I don't know how they got away once and said, "Give us a daughter, and - maybe she's a vampire, because we'll still love her more than sons, she'll be one - among them".
They said in the evil hour, that - look, they acquired another baby, but it was just a vampire girl! But, even so, these parents thought they had won a kingdom, as if they had had the Holy Mary born in their house! - their hearts laughed, now, like a summer sky, with plenty of sunshine!
Right. But it's not three or four days later that their mares - they were people - start to grate. The herdsman was going crazy seeing a mare die every day, and he couldn't figure out which beast was killing them: a wolf, a bear - some devil, he had no idea!
Man, eat him! What's going on here?
The master of the mares - when he saw the herdsman with the hides on the stick - shouted at him as long as he could, suspecting that he was somehow in league with the thieves.
From! What do you think? The poor herdsman was doing his job not yesterday, but the day before yesterday. And nobody ever complained about him. And now his master's going to do it with egg and vinegar? He couldn't stand it... He threw his headgear at him - and went about his business, haggling.
- I'll go and guard the mare, father, said the eldest son.
- Go on, Dad, but keep an eye out!
This one goes, he's on the lookout until the middle of the night - nothing. The mares were sleeping, like logs. Towards dawn, the boy lay down in a furrow, to close his eyes a little, for sleep was overtaking him, saying to himself: "The beast has not come before, nor will it come again."
But just as I was falling asleep, a kind of blue-black cloud appeared, like a thick blackness, over the cribs of the mares. But the cloud passed quickly and revealed three mares' bodies on the ground, like three brides - heartbreakingly pitiful!
The boy, awakened from his sleep, was in pain, seeing this misfortune and was even more worried that he had not been on the lookout until dawn!
Deeply distressed, he started for home, ashamed of his foolishness, as if he were going to have his head cut off.
- Forget it, my son," said his father, "it must be God's curse, for this misfortune strikes us not just once or twice, but every day. Let us be healthy!
The next day, the middle boy was on the lookout. He lurked as long as he lurked, and - towards morning, some kind of blackness, something dark, threw him into a heavy sleep, as if they'd put dead man's dust under his head! He didn't breathe till dawn! When he awoke, he saw three more of the most beautiful mares' carcasses lying on the ground.
He's back home too, as he wouldn't have wanted to be. And it wasn't so much his loss as the thought that he couldn't find out who their playmate was!
And so all the brothers, down to the youngest of them, were on the lookout. The parents didn't really want to leave him, because they were afraid something would happen to him, God forbid! But who can you get along with and make him stay at home? He said: "I'm leaving!" - gone he was, on the lookout.
He girded up his belt where he kept his bullets, took a club, his rifle - he stood guard too. This little boy, as the youngest of the house, his mother dressed him like a girl, before she gave birth to the vampire, that's what the woman wanted. And she wore it with earrings. That's why the vampire's spells couldn't do anything to him.
Towards dawn, he began to try to get the boy to sleep, but - nothing, he held on. As dawn broke, he could see the blackness, the black cloud, hanging over the manger. And he saw the ghosts that were running around tearing the animals to pieces!
The mule - fire once, fire twice, then snatches his club and swoops down on her, blowing her head off. And they thrust their hands into each other's clubs, and fought like that, for an hour! It's about to be daylight, and the ghost - no way to win! Seeing that she does not come out, she snatches herself from the hands of the strongman and melts back - from whence she came.
The boy, in his rampage, wounded the ghost on his little finger. He returned home and told how it was, how he fought it and hurt it. As he told the story, he cast his eyes to the little girl, who was asleep in the cradle, and - what to see? Just from her little finger - blood was dripping! "Ehe," he understood - "that's the ghost that's killing our mares!" Her very appearance was like a ghost!
- I'll kill her," cried the youngest, "we'll break her, for she's the enemy that's melting our cattle," and he drew his stick, and gagged her.
- Her mother and her father screamed, and they rushed to hold him, lest he kill the little girl!
If he saw this boy, he'd leave home and go out into the world.
It's been years - since then! The wanderer wandered everywhere, among strangers, until, one spring day, as he sat basking in the sun, he remembered home, his parents, his cattle, and tears came to his eyes, and he was overcome with grief and weeping. After a while, the longing for your homeland, for the home of your parents, for the people you knew, comes to you and makes you weak!
That's why he started for home, right away.
On the way she met a lioness in labor pains who could not give birth. The coachman made it easy for her to give birth, because he was good at it, from his mares. Then, in gratitude, he called the lioness:
- Take this token from me, that you were a good man, and when you find yourself in great trouble - set fire to it, and I will come to your aid at once!
He walked on, and came across a bear that was wasting away by a well - from which he could not drink, because his head did not fit through the stones of the guides. The boy took off his cap, filled it, and gave the beast a drink.
The bear, all in good spirits, gives him a strand of her hair and says:
- For your kindness' sake, take this hair, and when it gets hard, light it. I'll help you, wherever I am!
Later on our little boy runs into a wolf. He saves her from death, and gives her a lock of hair as a token of his help in her predicament.
When the poor boy arrived in the village, he was overcome with grief at what he could see: all the households - deserted and in ruins! It was as if the plague had swept through here: no sign of man, no cattle - nowhere! And, he suspected, only the vampire must have done all this.
Approaching the parental home, you were frightened by so much silence: no children, no women, no dogs in the yard, nothing! You wanted to run away in terror!
Still on the stairs, he sees the vampire before him! He freaks out too, but she loses her temper too, seeing him. He knew her fear, from the mares, from when he'd been on the prowl. That's why she rushed to take him with the good, with the plan, as she had done with the whole village when she had destroyed it.
The vampire kept her teeth in her cell. She had to get them out of there, but she was afraid the thug would run away in the meantime. She told him, grimly:
- Hold this tray, and the fork - play with them, until I cook some food downstairs.
Only she goes away, and - behold, a little mouse appears and says to the youngest:
- What are you standing there, you little shit, what are you standing there? Well, that one went for her teeth and - now she's coming back to kick your ass!
- Well, what do you think I should do?
- Quickly fill your sackcloth with ashes, go out through the chimney - where you will leave your sackcloth hanging, and then - where do you know to go!
So did the little mouse, and the little mouse - zdrang! zdrang! on the tray, making a fuss, lest the vampire should realize that the boy had washed the pot!
When the vampire turned around, what did she see? The little mouse was playing on the tray! She looks for the boy in the cupboards, she looks for him everywhere, but the boy - let's hear it for him! The enemy looks on the chimney-piece - and sees the isman there. It's him, the dog, she cried - and she rushes, as if in a rage, - with her claws, tear him to pieces! Only he only tears the ismana, and the ashes in it blind her to everything. Only she knows what she has shot till it lights up again, and then - run, like a madwoman, after the big man!
She followed him, and she caught up with him! The wanderer, seeing he was ready to catch him, what should he do? He spotted some poplars. He quickly climbed up one of them. But the vampire sunk her fangs into the poplar's trunk, tore it off and pulled it down. The boy, as the poplar fell, jumped onto another one from beside it. The vampire tore this one down, too.
Put one, put two poplars down, ready to put as many as were there. The waggoner had lost his temper!
- Ouch, he shouts - what am I going to do, the vampire is going to fry me!
Suddenly, he remembered the marks he had - from the lioness, the bear and the wolf. He escaped from the amnion, lit the hairs all at once, and - lo, the beasts ran to him, hardly breathing from running! Seeing them, the boy's heart leapt to his feet, and he said he was coming back to life - he, who until then had been like the unburied dead.
- Get her!" he spat at the beasts - "and, you crumbs, do me the vampire!
That's all the beasts needed to hear it, and they pounced on them!
- Wait, the big man shouts, stop, I'll ask her something!
The boy asked the vampire - where are his parents, where are his brothers, where is the world, where are the people's cattle, and what else was out there?
- I swallowed it, I swallowed it all! said the vampire.
- Get her now! the boy shouted once more to the beasts - which shattered it to pieces, so that there was nothing left of it.
Then, sitting on a stump of poplar cut by the vampire, he began to weep, with tears the size of plums, the death of his parents, and he was very unhappy.
And as he was just anointing his stick with the vampire's seul - a drop of tallow fell on the aspen stump, and - what do you think? The poplar suddenly grew back!
- Hey! he says - what's this?!
He takes the tallow again, and begins to anoint the pruned aspens, which - all of them - have grown back into place too. Then he also anoints the village place, and thus resurrects everything, his parents, his brothers, his cattle... Everything wakes up - as it once had!
- You see," said the big man to his parents, "didn't I tell you that the vampire was doing us harm? You didn't believe me and wouldn't let me kill her from the start! Did you see what she was capable of? Thank the beasts, without them the vampire would still be here!
- Dear, dear, said his parents - who would have thought it would turn out like this? But, long live us, for you have saved us from the nuisance - and may you have everything your heart desires!
And they wished their boy well, and he, the good man, wished the beasts well, and the beasts wished the lad, who had helped them to live. In the end, they had almost come to quarrel, each wanting to wish the other one well! I, who am telling the story here - if I saw that they didn't get along, as if they didn't need only good wishes, "Wait!", I said, "if you don't need them, give them to me"! That's what I said, I'll get the... greetings, and - run, with all of them! Here - let them get their hands on me, here they let me go, they chased me for I don't know how long, until I reached a river.
You know, they're ready to grab me, so I throw my cheers in the water, and say to my pursuers:
- If it's like that, here, take more wishes, if you can afford it! Everyone was left speechless. In the end, they each got their own way. And I - here I am, telling you this fairy tale, but - now, let someone else tell it!
BOB-NUT
It was - what wasn't.
Once there was a man and a woman. The poor men had no children, but they longed for a son, that they might have one. When they saw others with babies in their arms, or with sons, married, or even with grandchildren, they thought of them!
These two - they would not let the day of God pass - and they would not pray:
- Lord God, give us a baby boy!
But their plea was not answered. Then, as it came to them, they began to pray more softly, like this: "Lord, give us a child, and let him be as small as a chickpea."
When God grew weary of their begging, he wanted to get rid of them and gave them a son, but he was as small as a chickpea.
So what if it was small? It seemed to them that he was the Christ child himself; and they loved him like the eyes in their heads, and made him all their sails!
Well, but what to call it, what name to give it? They called him "Bob-Nut".
One day, his father went to the field to plow. His mother was very upset because she had no one to send the man there for lunch. But when Bob-Naut heard that his mother was only upset about this, he said to her:
- What do you care, Mom? I'll take them to the food court.
- Oh, how can you take it to her, you're a little one and you won't be able to, mother dear!
- So what if I'm small? Can't I take Daddy his lunch? Put everything you've got on the donkey and I'm off!
- All right, said his mother, go if you think you can, but be careful not to lose anything on the way.
Bob the mule, riding on his donkey, was on one ear and on the other, and he was getting up his courage, roaring, "Go, go, go, go, go, go! And on his neck, on his back, he carried his ear to the field.
His father, when he saw him, could not rejoice! He hugged him, kissed him and said:
- Have you come to bring light to parents and make them breathe life?
They had a nice, nice, nice lunch, then they roughed up the oxen to graze there, then they lay down in the shade to take a nap until the snow had passed.
At the chindie, having cooled down a bit, they started ploughing again. Bob-Nut, neither one nor two: let him have some! "No, baby, you're too young!" said his father, - but he: "Yes, I want to plow!"
What should the old man do? He let him have it.
Aggressive as he was, hopping on the back of one ox and the other, his plow was going straight! But here comes a caravan. The Chervangii - they see the oxen, they see them ploughing here, but they don't see the ploughman! "Well, damn! What's this?" - they wonder.
- Well, what can it be, says Bob-Nut's father, - my son-in-law, my plow!
- What son-in-law, man?!
Bob-Nut, hearing their speech, cried out from where he was:
- How? Me! Can't you Armenians see me?
The Chervanghii heard the voice, but could not see the boy.
They took a closer look and - what did they see? A little man: the size of a chickpea, alive! They held their hands on their bellies with laughter. This little fellow, a real needle - he was up to some tricks! What a cutie!
A rafter liked him and wanted to take him with him:
- Why don't you give this kid to me? - he says to his father Bob-Nut. He'd hand me my horses. I'll give you good money for him!
- Shall I give you my soul, my eyes in my head? No way! How many I have suffered to get it, and now I leave it to others?
But Bob-Nut: "Take the money, daddy, and leave me with it!".
No use his father said, no use he drew. Nothing! "I'm leaving - and don't bother while I'm black!" Then he winks at the old man, so that he understands that he's not leaving at all. He gets in his ear and whispers that he's going to take them by the nose and turn around.
Then his father stopped him and took his parallels.
Bob-Naut, riding - on one horse's hip, on another's hip, shouting at them and chasing them, not letting them move at all.
The Chervangis were laughing their heads off - and from now on they took care of the caravan, having the boy. They arrived at an inn, had some good wine, and went shopping, which they needed.
Left alone with the horses, he only drools a mule - that Bob-Mutt also crawls underneath and is silent. The chervangis come, look for Bob-Nut, call him - nothing! For fear of the beggar - because all the horses had bolted into the barn - the men didn't stay to look for ... chickpeas and other grains, but washed the well in a hurry!
They don't even get over the hill, and Bob-Nut starts back towards his father.
Haida-haida, he's reaching for a tree somewhere. Here, in the shade, a priest was resting, his donkey beside him, loaded with springs. The priest was asleep. The little boy, slowly, entered the priest's ear and howled once:
- Catch the priest, skin him alive!
Popa sprang to his feet - like a drunken gypsy. And he hears that talk again, and he figures there must be some villains. And where does he run off to - so that his legs can't even be seen! The presses, the donkey - go! Let him escape!
Before long, some sort of arnut appears, with a bag of coins. And - as they are: seeing a donkey without a master, let's give him a master - the donkey. He pinned the dodo's bag of coins to the saddle's cantle, and then took a long nap in the shade of the tree.
Bob-Nut yelled once in this one's ear too - like the popes before him, so that it shook the arse, the arsehole! So that he, too, made himself invisible, only he knows how!
Now our Neghiniță is riding on the donkey, and - jap!, jap! - he arrives at his father's, in the village.
- Where did you get these prescription pills and these yellow ones? he asked Bob-Nut.
- Well, where can they be from? I got the prescriptions from a rather zany priest, and the yolks - from a little arn.
- It's not a sin to take from a priest, son, because they win without sweat. But, and the arn - sure thing he stole the yolks from somewhere. Someone didn't give it to him!
And I was there too, and I also bought myself a yellow paper, and with it I bought you only beautiful things, but - on the way back, when I was just passing through the Daucati slum, the dogs jumped at me and - they made a mess of them!
MINCINOS
Once upon a time - a big deal. That was back in the days when people used to hunt fleas. It was the truth, a lie somehow, - that's all I know, because it's told from the ancestors.
There were once three brothers. The Tuscans were chervanags. Each one marked his mules otherwise for burdens. These brothers went out into the world to seek their fortune. Where were they to go with their caravans? Well, that's where they make more food!
The eldest, named Mitu, was born in a village that had alienated its ancestral Romanian language. There also lived a Candriu priest, who had all kinds of grain for sale.
Mitu went to buy, but the silly priest told him that he doesn't sell food for money, but only for lies.
- What, on lies? - said Mitu.
- Well, how! Thou tellest a great big lie - take the pieces; if my lie be more of a sort, - give me thy mules!
Mitu didn't take the deal badly. "What," he said to himself, "won't I be able to burn a lie into this fool's face, so I can take everything he's got around here, without any brambles?"
Good! But then the chervangi starts, and he throws you a lie from a pub - if you'd only stop thinking about it! - so you could see, from a post, that it wasn't something to believe... What do you think he said? "I saw an ox flying!" - there, what could the unfortunate man say! He thought he'd knocked the priest out with such a lie!
- Hey... hey... hey - says the priest - listen to me: I had an egg in a row and I climbed a mountain with it. The mountain - only rock, only boulders, rocks! I let go of the egg, right from the top of the mountain, and it jumps from rock to rock, I think you've never seen anything like it. Zdrong, truncated - the egg, the boulders, the rocks, and they went downhill roaring, like the end of the world! And here's my egg down in the valley, my brother, brand-new and whole, so that you'd think the hen had laid it now!
What else can Mitu do? It was clear that this priest had beaten him to the lie. He gave him the mules without a word! Then, with his head bowed by the foolishness he had done, he walked home.
Not much time passes and, lo and behold, Pitu comes behind, with his mules in a row; he was the middle brother and he was still looking for food.
- Which dishes do you have for sale? - he asks one, another.
- Popa has.
Let's go to the priest!
- Welcome, Father.
- Welcome, my friend!
- Do you have grain for sale?
- I have," said the pope.
- How many pars?
- Well, I don't give on money, only on miniuni. If he shakes your hand, catch me!
Pitu told himself he'd run into alms here! "Big deal - fooling a silly priest," he thought. Except that he also got what his brother got and he was left without mules, and now he's cursing his head off, because - is this a joke? It's just mules, and it stings when you lose one, but all of them!
The next day - here's the younger brother named Chitu.
While he was still asking, he also reached the chief priest for grain. The popa, - his song:
- On lies - on lies! Me - I really am made of lies, said Chitu.
Do they catch - that on which to strip! Will Chitu be left without mules, or will the priest be left without wealth - dishes, groceries, everything?
Popa thought it was always a bargain.
- Let me hear your lie!" he said.
- Forgive us, Father! Your Holiness first. It is fitting.
Popa - with his gobbledygook: lying with the egg! He said it, and then he waited for Chitu to tell his lie - to get his mules faster. It seemed to him that it was still easy for him.
Chitu sat down nicely, composedly, and let go:
- It was, my dear parents - in the days of my youth! One day, when my father had just been born, I was at my grandparents' house, and I was pulling on my horn. When, who do I see - my great-grandparents even, who came running to tell me: "Come on, your father has been born!" "So what if he was born? - I ask - what do you want from me?" "What do we want - that you have to go and get the godfather to come and baptize him!" they say, the poor old men.
Where's the godfather to be found? I search the ground, I look for him, I search, I search - the godfather, nowhere! I think, if he's not on earth, I'll be with the good Lord. And there he was!
Word is - how do I get there? I look up to the sky and I shudder, how far and high it is! But anyway, I had to go, hard and easy! There was no one else to call - the whole burden fell on me.
I twist, I turn - maybe I'll find a ladder, climb it - nothing! And then, I don't know how, I look in my bosom and - lo and behold - there's a pumpkin seed. You know, a great-granddaughter of a great-granddaughter of mine had once sprouted some of these seeds, and because she'd given me some to spit out - just so I'd have something to do - I had one left in my breast, and I'd put it in. I took the seed, I sowed it, and it grew a pumpkin seed - up to God! I climbed up the pumpkin tree to the Lord, and called out to the godfather: "Come on, man, they're calling you to baptize my father!" And the godfather came down, eating the pumpkin quickly, and I cast my eyes round to see what a haze God had here, and God was here; but in the meantime a donkey woke up, lying dead beside the pumpkin, and - gossiping, gossiping - he was grazing on the pumpkin as if he had never been! Well? What are you doing now, Chitule?
As I was scratching myself like this, without knowing it, I see in my breast - still in my breast! - an end of thread in a needle, left here from my days as a tailor. I let it down - in a thread, not enough. I let it out in two - that's enough and it stays! Then I let myself down on the thread and, knot by knot, I slip a little, when - what do you think? It starts thundering and a hailstorm comes in - end of the world! I'm chasing after a knot and I'm silent - until it passes. As the storm has been raging, I go downstairs and find everything in its place. Daddy's brought home from the christening, screaming. I see the godfather and I say, "What's wrong with this godfather, this father, yelling like that?" "Well, what's wrong with him," he says, "he's asking for nuts - evil! Does he have a belly for eating nuts?" I approach a walnut tree and start throwing stones at it. Up, up, down, nothing! The walnuts don't fall, it's like someone is holding them. Then I shake the tree and, what do you know - there's not a nut left on its branches! I brought them to my father. I haven't seen such a greedy child since I was a child! He gobbled up the nuts, shell and all, like they were nothing.
I have no sooner sat down and warmed up a little, when - lo and behold, a great-grandson comes and says to me: "What are you waiting for, baby! Don't you know your father needs a swing? Well, don't you think - what are we going to put him in?" I get up, my brother, mad as a hatter, I snatch an axe, I take forty donkeys with me from the people's huts and - come on, let's go to the woods. I look this way, I look that way, and I see - across a water, as far as the eye can see - something beating in the black. It was a dark wood. Only, you see - how do I cross this river? Especially as the river was wide, and swollen, raging - you were terrified to look at it, not to cross it! I was just scratching myself, without being itchy - as happens at times like this - when I came across a hazelnut shell. I don't waste any more time, I climb up on it, one by one, I climb up and drop the shell in the river; I quickly get out on the other side. Then I enter the wood, I cross it from one edge to the other, I cross it once more, to find a tree, a wood of any kind - nothing! Well, you know, Father, I could have slapped myself in the face! But suddenly I see a bramble bush! I lay my axe on it, and in a flash - bang, bang! I make forty loads of good wood, in my head! I load them on the donkeys and - away! But as I lay down, I got so hot, so sunburnt, that I didn't know where to hide. Luckily for me, a mushroom comes my way. I tied my donkeys to its shade and I lay down and took a nap - at his mother's! Then I loosened my grip, loaded the donkeys again and, haida-haida... On the way I got thirsty, but water - neam! As-necum, I passed a well. It wasn't really a well, because I didn't have a bucket or anything to get it! What was to be done? I cut off my head and threw him in the well to water.
Oblivious as I am, I moved on, donkeys in tow. On my way, people were reaping and making pancakes. Having nothing else to do, I unloaded the donkeys and took my axe to the wood. I cut them all down, but I still didn't have enough for a swing! Don't you die of fright? Well, of course, when it's going so wrong! I'm so angry, I go into a hut. I want to get in, but I can't. Well, well, well, what's this? Well, there was a little bit left in the edge of the hatchet, and that little bit was banging against the top of the hut, that's why I couldn't get in. I know, I say, and I start, I take my axe to the axe, and - burn it this way, burn it that way, the swing is ready!
I had just finished and was getting ready to take her home. But what would you see? Everybody was yelling at me - like a bear! They were laughing their heads off, looking at me. "Hey, you guys, what's the matter with you, melting like that - Holy Mother of God!" "Well, how can we not melt, you silly little fool!" they said. "Aren't you looking - where's your head?!"
I'll put my hand, I'll feel my head, - no head! I'd forgotten it in the well. Run, back, after the head. There, what do you think they saw me... my ears? My poor stool, sitting on the lip of the well, had just been eaten by a fox. As I was hot, sparks flew from my eyes, I took a rock and threw it at the fox. She, the heathen, willy-nilly - pulls out a thread... Well, what do you think it said in the sign?
(At this point, Chitu stopped, but the priest - who was dying to know what he was saying - asked impatiently):
- There, there! What did that guy say?
- Well, he said to give me the mules, the meat, and everything you've got! As was our agreement, and - if you still feel like it, hurry up and race someone else in lies...
Willingly or unwillingly, the sinful priest paid, as they say - as a priest, understanding that he found his godfather! Then he lowered his nose, down a hand, and said no more.
Lie lie lie,
But it was good!
Halal-mincinos,
Who can say it!
DRACULA MILL
Once upon a time. If it hadn't been - it wouldn't have been told.
There were once two brothers. One of them was a man with a lot of money, a big householder; he had so much money that they threw him out of the house. The other was so poor that he couldn't get a drink of water. And this one had a bunch of children, too, for his abject poverty.
But at least he was lazy, poor man, but he didn't run away from work, no - as soon as it was dawn and until nightfall, he didn't stop working, but his work didn't work and that was it! It seemed to be a fact: in his hand - and gold turned to stone, like hell.
Now, on ordinary days it was like that, but when a holiday came around, the cold got him! For example, at Easter: he was cutting up a lamb, he was getting new clothes, - only he, the poor thing, stood aside and kept looking at others. And when he was thinking of going home, his hair would turn to silk! Because children are children... When they saw him on a day like this, they'd say, "What have you got for me, Daddy?" - One, "What did you get me, Daddy?" - another, "Aren't you going to buy us lamb, Daddy?" - and many others!
If he thought what he thought, hop! - to his brother had him, just like that, on the spur of the moment, and says:
- Give me a lamb, or I'm not moving from here!
He was rich and rich, but he was a cheapskate, he ate from under his fingernail! So he didn't even want to hear it at first. But since the poor one wouldn't let him off the hook by keeping it that way: "Give me a lamb, give me a lamb, so that I can enjoy Easter with my family"... -
- Na- te him! he said, and go to hell and take him with you!
The poor brother, being a bit of a lion, throws the lamb over his shoulder and lays it down, to hell with it! Come on, as he was walking along, a little devil comes along and says:
- Where to, my friend?
- Well, to hell with it. Maybe you can tell me the way there...
- Gladly! Because I'm just a devil. But, what business is it of ours?
- Well, let me bring you this lamb as an Easter gift!" said the poor man.
Now imagine the joy of the stoned at such words!
- Buddy, that guy says, you know what?
- I don't know!
- Let me tell you, if you don't know.
- Well, tell me.
- Look: you're the only one who thought of us. That's why I'm going to do you a favor: wherever you go, Scaraotchi will ask you what you want for your gift. He'll tempt you with coins, jewels, jewels, diamonds, but don't you get any!
- How so? Forgive me, but I'm not completely stupid yet!
- You take heed of me: ask for nothing but the peppercorn under the bedding of Scarauatsky.
- Look, I saw a stupid devil! Well, how? Shall I leave my parallels and diamonds and whatnot for a lousy pepper mill?
- You're talking nonsense because you don't know what kind of a crumb this is! It's enchanted, it's not like all the others: this one, whatever you ask for, it'll get you, stupid! Are you from home?
- Hey! If that's the case, it changes things...
And as they talked and walked and talked and walked, they found themselves in the Valley of the Devil. And there the poor man gave the lamb to Scarauatsky. He asks him what he would like in return, what his heart would like, that he would give him anything.
Poor thing, as the little devil had taught him on the road, he said:
- I want a little something, brother, because, you see, I have a long way to go back, and it will be hard. That's why I'll ask you to give me only the peppercorn under your bed...
Scaratchi paled, and his eyes were filled with sparks of annoyance when he heard! He promised him all sorts of other things, all the expensive ones, promised him a few coins, no matter how many, just to leave the mill, but it was in vain! He couldn't be persuaded! The poor fellow kept it up: "the millstone and only the millstone!"
What else could Scaratchi do? He had agreed to give him whatever he asked, he had to keep his mouth shut. So he took the millstone, and - out of spite - threw it at his head! Let him get out of his sight!
Poor thing, what else did he want? He'd grab the shredder and melt away! He stopped in an orchard to catch his breath. Hungry as he was, he sat down for a meal, and thundered fearfully:
- Food and water, not chatter!
And where do they not start all sorts of dishes, each one more tasty than the next - don't you believe it, where do they come from! Even the emperor, while he was emperor, had not seen so many delicacies!
He got fed up and then took off again, towards home, as was good for him.
On his way, he meets someone, a man holding and twirling a rod.
- Good luck! One.
- Live! - the other.
- Where to, good luck?" asked the poor man.
- What can I tell you, said this one. I don't even know where I come from or where I'm going. I'm walking around like a stray dog - towards... where the road will take me. But to cut a long story short: don't you ever get a piece of bread? My guts are itching to eat!
- That's an easy job, said the miller (for the man had a millstone now!) food and drink I'll give you as much as your heart desires!
He twists the millstone once and says:
- Food and water, not chatter!
And the food - it still came from who knows where!
- Boy, would the wolves eat you up, - well, where do you get all these goodies from? You didn't have them in your pocket?
- The mill, my friend, the mill - she grinds them, what do I know how?!
- Well, how come?
The poor man told him the whole story, with his little millstone.
- Woe is me and mine, he wonders! I thought only my rod was what it is!
- But what's up, man, with your rod?
- What, what's wrong with my rod?! Well, when I want to send someone to the next world - jart!, with my rod - and it gives the pope's ort on the spot!
- What are you talking about? And you don't want to trade, do you? - said the poor guy.
- No, I thought so!
He gives the poor man his rod and his staff. But when he saw himself with the rod in his hand, he commanded him:
- Here, make me this one so I can sell you, my dear rod!
The rod didn't wait for him to say it again, and he burned the guy, who just said: "Gobble, gobble, gobble! The poor man took his rod and his rod and - gone he was.
The man arrived home. To see now - all sorts of things, in his house, to see and not believe! New clothes only, sturdy and clean, and for himself and his little ones - such as the emperor would not have in his hand! Then food - you can't even name it all with words. You would have thought that this was the birth of Christ, and no other - so much wealth and happiness had come into the poor man's house!
People knew him to be poor-glued, so, seeing him now in church, on the day of the Second Resurrection, still in silk, he and his family, the villagers were left speechless with amazement! That's not clean, people thought. He must have robbed some rich man. But they still couldn't believe that he was somewhere - a man so out of his depth! What could it be, what could it be, they wondered.
His brother, the rich man - seemed now, compared to the poor man of old, a sort of a scared and shy little dog, with his tail between his legs - when he would run into a bear; and his sons - you said they were like gypsy's kids, compared to sons of great men!
From mouth to mouth the story reached the ears of the emperor, who sent for him to tell him where all this wealth came from, from whom did this poor man steal it?!
- Whoever wants to see me," he replied, "let him come to my house.
The emperor waited so long - and seemed to catch fire - flames shooting from his nostrils in anger.
- Bring him to me beforehand, dead or alive," he commanded his soldiers. I said, and - so be it!
But you've found someone to bring! Only when the soldiers came close to the poor one, and - bang! this one with his enchanted rod - to put them all down forever.
When the emperor saw that he was not to be trifled with, little brother, and that he was without an army - "come on," he said, "let's take the madman with the good, otherwise I won't get him to the head". And so, of his own free will, of his own necessity, he got up and went to the old poor fellow, and made himself smaller, bowing his forehead, and he was afraid - lest it should be worse for the emperor. Then the former poor man returned her visit, and she bequeathed to him a great favor, such as had not been mentioned -
And I went
I'm going to see them too,
And you were riding on a fiery red horse,
And I told you a lying fairy tale!
THE BULLOCK AND HIS SISTER
Once upon a time - never seen again!
At one time, there lived, it is said, nine thieves, known in all four winds for the misfortunes they brought, for the houses they siezed. So terrified were they that no one dared to go anywhere; all the roads were closed, and woe to him who was driven from the village by fate, for he could not take two steps and fell immediately into the hands of the thieves.
They steal - today, steal - tomorrow, loot them today, loot them tomorrow, that's how they saved up - a lot! They kept their money in a house built in the heart of the forest, where only thieves, or some thug could enter.
What did these bad guys say to each other? - to trample on a poor man's house who had been dead for days. They were thinking of kidnapping his daughter and taking her to their place in the mountains.
When darkness fell, the thieves entered the village with the cattle from the field, surrounded the girl's house and, well hidden, waited for her to come out, catch her and take her away.
They waited as long as they waited, an hour, two, three, nothing - the girl didn't even think of going out. They were just about to leave when suddenly they heard noises in the house. The girl immediately appeared and went towards her father's grave in the garden in front of the courtyard.
It was the middle of the night. The people in the house didn't feel a thing, because they were fast asleep, chopping wood on them!
They called the girl Stamùla, that was her name.
At dawn, the girl's mother wakes up, then her brother, they are waiting for Stamùla to get up and get her morning snack, - but Stamùla doesn't look at all!
They didn't say anything at first, the girl must be fast asleep, never mind... But after a while, it got light, and people came in to see what was going on with this sleep, so... They go into Stamùla, pull the covers and - what can you see? Just the bare, bare bedding, and Stamùla - nowhere!
They understood that thieves stole it. What was to be done?
Where to go, where to look for her? Voinicu, Stamùla's brother, was brave enough, and he wasn't afraid of thieves - just like these ones, but where to go, he had no idea. They hired men to track him down, promised a lot of money, just to find out something, to bring some news, just a little, there.
Several days passed. When they kidnapped Stamùla, to take her to the mountain, on the road - who knows how, near a water, the girl's ring got caught on a twig - and there she stayed!
One day, while walking downhill to wash something, the girl's mother comes across the ring while gathering dryers for the fire. At home she shows the Voinic the ring, and the Voinic has figured out that the thieves must have climbed up to the "Saint". What does he do then? He takes the ring, wraps it in a strip of his shirt, ties it tightly and says: "I will not untie this patch until I see my sister, and until she too sees the place where my father's bones lie; nor will I wash this shirt until my sister comes to wash it for me."
Then he sheathed his sword, took his rifle on his shoulder, called a friend with him, and, with this boy together - they mounted two winged horses, swallowing clouds no other - and hurried to find and rescue the too beautiful Stamùla from the hands of thieves.
They walked, they walked, they walked, they walked through forests, mountains, they walked through caves, but they never found the thieves.
One evening, tired, tired, exhausted, they came to a thick forest, pinned their horses to a tree and went into it, to trample it, because they had not been able to walk through it.
Voinicu, the girl's brother, with his companion, went into the forest to see what and how. What couldn't you find there? All sorts of creatures, wild animals, you'd think this place was their kingdom! They even came across an old house, who knows how long ago! The boys are searching, rummaging through the rooms - but there's not a sound anywhere. The house was deserted. They have been searching the forest in a criss-cross and in a criss-cross for three years. They never found the thieves, though.
At last they come to a dark and thick wood, where it was always night. There you could hear voices, but you couldn't see the world, because you couldn't see through the darkness at all. They just sat and listened. They climbed up a tree, the tallest one there - and looked all around, and listened again, to find out where the voices were coming from. When, what do you know? Some thieves - black as peacocks, came out of the clouds.
The two boys stood still until the thieves left, then they started down the same slope as them, and haida-haida - they reached an iron house. The house belonged to the nine thieves who had kidnapped Stamùla and kept her there, locked up. Voinicu entered the iron house with his companion and began to search the rooms. But there was no sign of a man! But as they searched, they came upon a room with a girl in it, combing her hair and singing a mournful song. She was lamenting her poor, unhappy fate.
Voinicu, only he sees her and knows her, by her face, by her voice, that she was his sister, for whom he had not slept for so long! Suddenly he's beside her, he embraces her, kisses her tenderly, they both cry so hard it breaks your heart: for more than three years, the poor things hadn't seen each other, hadn't heard each other's voice!
- All the same, my brother," said Stamùla, "but what are we going to do, because here come those thieving dogs - and they'll swallow you alive, with your companion and all, if they find you here!
- I'm not afraid, sister - a hundred it is! said the boy.
But what are our sons doing to me? I keep the places where the thieves were to come, and - when they return from whence they went: "bam!, bum!" with their rifles, until they've all been roasted like St. Mary's rams for the feast.
After they had killed them all, the boys loaded up all the wealth of the thieves, collected from the impoverished for years, and erected a sort of inn at the crossroads, where travellers from the four winds used to stop, so that they could feast on everything without paying a penny!
The two boys and the girl returned home, and when their mothers saw them, they grew still with a clap of joy! After that, a few days later, three weddings took place there, on the same day: the wedding of the maiden, the bridegroom and his companion.
They all hooted and hollered, they pounded the ground with their asses for a week, as long as the weddings lasted. I hopped as much as I could, and if I got tired, I stopped hopping and - look at me, here I am.
And I knew a story too, and I told it to you as it is, it wasn't too good, but look - I laughed a little at you!
STONE UNDER THE TONGUE
Once upon a time.
There was once a poor man stuck. His parents were old, and couldn't work. All their hope was in him, Mitru. The boy worked, but - what can you do, that was his luck: he didn't work, and peace!
Seeing this, that he was working so hard in vain, what did he think? "Let's change a little, let's go somewhere else, somewhere among strangers", so that maybe, you know - God will help me!
He made his cross and went on his way - good riddance, with the One from above as his rock.
But even there, far away, he did not do much good. He worked for three years, and for the three years he finished - he earned only three asps in all.
Three, - three! That's what God wanted! And he put them in the bag and went home to see his elders.
Merse, merse way. When he was just a little way from reaching his family, he saw some children who had tied up a dog somewhere and were beating it to death. Mitru felt sorry for the dog and said to the children:
- How much do you want me to give you to stop killing the dog?
- A rough one! - they said.
- He took out the bag, gave them the dog, took the dog and went home. But after a while, he came across other children. They had tied up a cat, and were about to kill it.
Mitru also pitied the cat.
- Come on, I'll give you a rough one - just don't kill her, he told them.
- Well, give it to us, they grated.
And he gave them a sharp one, and took the cat with him.
He only had one rough left in his bag. But he didn't get home with that one either, because Mitru was like that... Then you have to have a little luck, and Mitru's luck must have been blind! A little further on, he came across other children who had caught a snake and wanted to kill it. Mitru, merciful as usual, took pity again, and bought the snake, giving away the rest of his body.
When he was near the village, people came out to greet him, as is customary in such circumstances: "Mitru is coming, Mitru is coming!" Why, the man had come from far away, from abroad: gone for three years, it was no joke! Everyone shook his hand, hugged him, kissed him... In the evening, he was home.
They set the table, his people. They ate what God gave them, and the old woman said to her son-in-law:
- Now, Mother dear, let's see what you've brought us from wherever you've been!
- Bring the bags, the boy said.
They brought them to him, and Mithras began to pull out first the dog, then the cat, and finally the snake - from where he had pushed them (great wonder they didn't give up the ghost there!).
- Here, what have I brought you," he said, and then he told us everything that had happened to you.
Seeing what the poor old men brought their son from wherever he had been, they poisoned their souls.
They were waiting for him to return home with their money, with their savings, when - what did the boy bring them? A dog, a cat and a snake! What a thing!
Many days have passed since then. Mitru stayed at home, in the village. Why beat the foreign roads? Well, - as if, if he'd been away, he'd made a hole in the water somewhere!
The dog, the cat and the snake took her to Mitru like in heaven and they were like brothers. The snake missed his own. He hadn't seen them for a long time. He asked Mitru to take him to them, and not to be afraid when he saw so many snakes, that they wouldn't harm him. He only asked her not to forget one thing: to tell the old three-headed serpent, who is king over his people, to give him the "stone under his tongue". This stone, if you put it under your tongue, - it could grant you any wish, on the spot!
Mitru is going to get all this well in his glaze, not to forget anything, he takes the snake with him and - this way you go!
They walked as far as they went - and ended up at the serpentine. There, what can you see? Everywhere, all kinds of snakes and lizards - hissing, leaping about, terrifying! But Mitru didn't even bother, knowing he had nothing to fear.
And the parents of the serpent, when they saw their young again, rejoiced greatly, because they had made it part of the household of the living.
To repay Miter, they told him to ask whatever his heart desired, because the joy he had given them was not one of those that are easily repaid with one or two. He could therefore ask them for coins with sacks, with a load, or expensive things - they would give them to him immediately.
But Mitru knew what to ask for! Wasn't he, Mitru, stupid! The snake had taught him at home what and how.
- Give me, he said, the stone under my tongue!
The snakes didn't even think that Mitru would ask them for the stone. They turned and turned, for it was not good for them - how could they give the stone? but willingly or unwillingly, to keep their word, they did this too.
Mitru threw this stone into his bosom, said goodbye to the snake people and - wasting no more time, went straight home. He went into the house, and, neither once nor twice, he put the stone under his tongue and said:
- Let my shack be made, this very moment, a palace greater than our emperor's!
He just says it, and - what do you know! In place of Mithras's chimney, the one with the roof only as high as a man's stature, there now stands a palace - to take your eyes away when you look at it! The whole village was stunned at the wonder. The people watched, dumbfounded, they crossed themselves and said:
- How could this man, so suddenly, do such a thing?
The Emperor - he was no less surprised. He kept rubbing his eyes and couldn't believe it. He could have sworn his eyes were deceiving him! That's why he called Mithras to him and asked:
- How did you do it, man, to build such a palace!
- He spoke a word - and it was done, said Mitru.
- Well, how so?
- There you go.
- If you are able to do so easily, then - by tomorrow, make me a road, all laid with silver, from my palace to yours. If you succeed, I'll give you half the kingdom - and my daughter to wife!
- It's done, no way, said Mitru.
He returned home, and he put the stone under his tongue, and - saying, "Let there be a road paved with silver from the emperor to me," - he did so.
If the emperor saw that, what would he say? He gave him the girl for his wife, and half the kingdom, as they said.
They had a royal wedding, and - well done, Mitre, for seeing yourself son-in-law of an emperor! Now, who else was like him? He could no longer fit into his skin, as one who had never before met with such good fortune. Only his luck was broken: he couldn't get along with his wife! She was tangled up with a harp, and she was still thinking about him! He did what he did, to get rid of Mitru, and - ran to the harp. What do you want, Eva - that's all!
One day, what goes through her head? "How does this one do such wonders? He must have some little thing, something, or he's being helped by I don't know who, because I don't think he could do so much with his strength alone!"
She grabs and asks him:
- Tell me, man, how do you manage to do everything you can think of? Where do you get so much power?
Mitru didn't even think of saying anything. But the woman, from then on, did not leave him alone, she drove him crazy: "Either you tell me, or I don't know what's happening to me!" Mitru, also a man, was persuaded and told her. If you have secrets from your wife, who can you not have them with, your neighbours? How could he imagine what his wife was up to!
One night, while Mitru was asleep, this sinner wakes up and - gently, gently - steals the stone from under his tongue. Then she poured it into her mouth and said:
- I'll be at the harp this minute, across the sea!
She said it, and it was done: she even fell into the arms of the harp, the shameless girl!
Mitru wakes up at dawn, he looks for the woman, the woman - nowhere; he looks for the stone, - the stone is gone! He was going mad, he was in trouble, he was going to slap himself and that was it - for the stupid thing he had done! When he looks around, not a trace of the palace, of all the others he steals! For the woman, as soon as she got beyond the Sea, said no more palace - and perished, as if it had never been!
Poor Mitru! Had the bullets pierced him - and not a drop of blood would have flowed from him, so angry and poisoned was he now. What was he to do, what was he to fix? He understood that his wife had passed the sea, but how could he? It wasn't an easy job, to do it this way, one or two.
At that moment the dog enters the room, followed by the cat. They ask him, more or less in passing, what's happened to him that he's so poor, as if the crows have ruined his crate!
Mitru opens up to them - how the stone was stolen from under his tongue...
- Don't be afraid and don't be angry! said the two animals; we will go after her and steal her from the harp.
And they go, and they go, and they go, and they cross the sea and they reach the harp, just when it is getting dark. The dog stayed at the gate, and the cat crept in - like cats in a house. And as she stood there, - behold, a little mouse sprang up before her. Hap! - the cat, at him, and grabs him!
- Don't eat me, says the poor mouse, or I'll do you some good!
- All right, said the cat, I forgive you, but go tonight and steal the stone from under the tongue of the hen the harp sleeps with.
The mouse swore he would do exactly that, only to leave him alive. Then he dipped his tail in the oil, and after that - and rolled it in a pan of red pepper. But what next? Well, easy, easy, easy, easy, he crawled up to the woman, and when she was in her sweetest sleep, he stuck his tail in her nose. The woman sneezed, and - like that, the stone jumped out of her! The mouse wanted nothing else - and ran with her to the cat! The cat shoves the stone in her mouth, and - she doesn't even know how she runs to the dog!
Together, they put their tails on their backs and, come dawn, they met on the seashore.
- Now," said the dog, "put your head on me, and hold the stone tightly in your mouth, lest you fall into the water and get bitten by the adder!
But about halfway across the sea, what's coming to the dog? He turns, and says over his shoulder, "Cat.
- Show it to me so I can see it - what kind of rock is that!
- Well, how so? You want me to fall in the water?
You've got yourself a dog to understand! This one was holding it - one:
- Either you show me or I'll throw you in the sea!
Give the cat to show him, and - here, drop the rock in the water! What to do now? Come back without the stone? What a shame, my God!
But the cat, more daring in these matters, as soon as they went ashore, where the water was shallow, she did what she did and grabbed the fish emperor!
- Aman-aman!, this one did. Don't eat me, and I'll do you some good, for I'm king over all fish.
- Then command them to bring me the stone from under my tongue at once! That's the only way you'll live!
The fish came, one by one, looking at each other, - no one took it. The emperor counted them, so that no one was missing, and noticed that one small, tiny fish was missing. They brought this one to their eldest, asked him for the stone and - wonder - he had it! The little mother puts her paw on it and lets the little fish into the water.
In a heartbeat they reached their good master, who was sick and dying - of grief, for the stone. When he saw the dog and the cat running from afar, he knew they had done a good job. And as soon as he saw himself again with the stone under his tongue, he immediately became a healthy cannon!
Quickly - he put his palaces back together, with all that was required, all sorts of wonders, and - in spite of his first wife, he married another girl, even more beautiful, the daughter of an emperor too, and the man lived - until he died too.
And look here,
The fairy tale ends -
and I came back from there, and I was bringing you a pair of boots, but the boots being red, and as I passed by Toși's yard - the dogs, the little dogs, came and snatched them from my hands, because they thought they were a bit cool...
THE NINE-HEADED DRAGON
Once upon a time.
In a row, and at one time - there were somewhere two women. And both of them suddenly acquired a son.
These boys, who had always grown up together, loved each other so much that they would have given their lives for each other.
When the time came for them to go out into the world, they left together.
They go, they go - and they come to a place where the roads cross. That's where they stopped, to see which way to go. There were all kinds of beasts here, all the beasts in the world: lions, wolves, bears, foxes and others.
They decided to part now, and to divide the beasts they had come across in this place.
And, like brothers, as they felt, they did not quarrel when sharing. One took the beasts - the male part, the other - the female part.
When they parted, they exchanged rings and swore to each other: when the ring of one bleeds, let it be known that this one is in great distress - and then the other must run to his aid.
Then they went their separate ways, one this way, the other that way.
The beast-taker - male part, Dona by name, meets an emperor's daughter on the way, beautiful-fire! She cried, unhappy, heartbroken for her.
Dona, the moment he saw her, he was in tears. He went up to the girl and asked her:
- What happened to you, beautiful girl, that you're drowning in tears?
- How can I not choke back tears and break down in pain?" said the girl. Look, in a little while, that dragon-faced wolf will come and destroy me!
And the girl told him about the custom of the land, - how the people here suffer for water, that they have to give a man's soul every day, and that only in this way does the dragon drain their springs, and that today the fates fall on her.
- And!" said Dona. Is that why you're killing yourself? Don't worry; as long as I live - your head won't hurt!
And, as he was weary with walking, he lay down to rest a little, resting his head on the girl's knees. By this time, his eyes were clouded with sleep. But he didn't get a chance to fall asleep, because the dragon showed up. As soon as she saw him, the emperor's daughter shed her tears again.
One of her tears fell on Dona's cheek, and she woke up immediately, just as the dragon was approaching them, and seeing them, she was glad that she had two angels to eat, instead of one, as on the other days.
The lad, however, beckoned to his savages, and - when they were spitting at my dragon, the dust came up. Which one had a thistle, which one got a thistle, which one got something else, what each one could.
Then the waters, the valleys, the streams began to flow, so much so that you said: what could this be?! Because before, the dragon only released water with one finger.
Dona pulls the knife from her belt, and cuts out the nine tongues of the dragon, from as many heads, she strings them on a silk thread and then throws them behind the neck.
Everyone was astonished, stunned by what they heard, but no one dared to go and see what was going on.
A harp, who had brought the emperor's daughter to the dragon, and was sitting in hiding, as soon as he saw that the beast had given up the ghost, wasted no time, but crept up and stabbed Dona in the back, leaving him dead. Then he forces the girl to swear that she'll keep quiet if she doesn't want her head to fly off. The girl swore, what can she do!
When the emperor learned that the harpoon had saved his daughter and killed the dragon, he could not rejoice any longer! What to give him, what good to do him, - let's give him his daughter to wife. Just on the thought of the harp! In a week the wedding was to take place.
Dona's poor little savages, always crying for their master and not moving from him.
While they were mourning him like that, a songbird swoops down and begins to call out from its tiny little plis:
- If you want him to wake up, get your hands on a nice pussy, like me, cut it up and drip its blood in the little fella's ear. That's what the songbird called it.
The fox listened to her with her mouth wide open, and the more the bird said, the closer she came and prayed:
- What did you say, dear bird, that I'm old, can't I hear? I'm an old woman. Come here, come here - this old age is deafening me.
The bird kept dropping down on a branch, until the fox, with its tricks, once sprang up and grabbed it:
- Pretty bird," said the cunning woman, "I should have looked for you with the candle, and I couldn't find you at a time of great need like this!
That's it, and she ripped off his little head, dripped blood into Dona's ear, and the lad came to life on the spot.
It seemed to Dona that he was really asleep, and once awake, he said:
- Why are you waking me up? How sweet I was sleeping!
- What sleep, woe and woe to you, that this was pure death! - so cried the beasts to him in one voice, and they racked all, as the harp had slain him.
- Well, let it be," said he, "that a harp should kill me? Wait, see what I'll do to him!
And off he went, come on, right out to the emperor's village.
He had just happened to be on the wedding day of the daughter of the emperor with the harp. The lady, entering the village, stopped at an old woman's house to drink a little water because she was parched with thirst. One thing led to another and the old woman told her that today was a big wedding day, because the emperor's daughter was getting married - to the harp that had saved her from death.
The lady, hearing the commotion, went - so unmarried, straight to the church, where the wedding was to take place.
When the priest blessed them at the wedding: "Hold on!" he shouted. That didn't save her from death!"
The emperor's face, as she saw him, brightened her soul.
As-necum, he got the bully before the emperor. The harpy, too, to defend his honour, blamed Dona - that he would lie.
After he had turned the harp that way enough, they listened to Dona.
I forgot to say, - the harp had cut off the nine heads of the dragon, and brought them with him, as a testimony of his bravery...
Now Dona is talking:
- I would ask you: have you ever mentioned heads - without tongues?
- I didn't mention it!" said the emperor.
- Then consider the heads of the dragon: where are their tongues?
They looked, - they were all without tongues!
The harp, that paper, that bitch, defended himself, that he cut out the tongues, but he doesn't know what he did with them, and so on... Nothing! His words were in the wind, for Dona also took out the tongues from her bosom, where she had hidden them, and gave them to the emperor to see.
When they called the emperor's daughter to tell how and what she was, she also showed the truth from head to tail.
And then they take my harp, and tie it to two wild horses, and slap them on their backs, so that they make it - all whinnying and neighing! After which, Dona married the emperor's daughter. But at the table, the emperor sighs before he can put anything in his mouth. When the meal is over, he sighs again!
- What's the matter, my lord?" asked Dona this time.
- How shall I put it, son? Because I have another nail in my heart: there's a bad ford in that forest; whenever my army went through there, they never came back! If I could only get rid of this trouble, I wouldn't need anything else in the world.
What kind of vad was that? Whenever a human soul would pass through there, there would be a hailstorm, a storm, you'd think it was the end of the world. There was an old witch living in her hut. As it began to thunder, lightning and thunder, the witch would beg passers-by to take shelter in her hut and wait, supposedly until the storm passed. Once the people were inside her house, the old woman would sweep them all off their feet.
Dona, so as not to spoil her father-in-law's joy, called her wild beasts, and - let them see what it is, whatever it is!
They just got there and - lo and behold! a thunder and a storm starts, shaking the ground from the boobs. And there's that damned old woman, with her hoarse voice, calling him into the hut - until the storm calms down.
Only he entered the shelter, together with the beasts, and - when the old woman sweeps once, he makes marble!
At that moment, Dona's brother's ring - for brothers these two men considered themselves - bled on the spot! And the boy understood that it was not a clean thing, and that his brother must have been very ill. That's why he started it, to get him out of trouble, wherever he was.
Haida-haida, man to man, followed him, and came to the king's village. When the emperor saw him in the forest, with the wild beasts after him, he thought he was his son-in-law. Only when he realized that the beasts were not part man, did he understand who he was, and told him all about it.
That's what Dona's companion wanted, so he'd know what to do.
And as soon as he sees himself in the forest in question, the hail and storm start up again, raging. The old hag called him into the hut to stay there until the storm passed. So, clever in mind, the boy turns it on her like this:
- Forget it, granny, don't worry about me, I'll come!
And he didn't go into the hut until the storm and the hail had stopped. Well, the old woman's dill was only as strong as the hail and the storm. As soon as these things passed, neither her spell nor her broom was worth a damn. And these didn't last more than three hours.
The rogue finally rushes to the old woman with his beasts, grabs the witch by the back of her neck, and hisses:
- I want my brother, you little scrounger, or I'll break you!
The witch, close to the door, teaches the boy to take a cup from a pulpit, a cup of water enchanted by the three witches, to sprinkle it on Dona, and he wakes up immediately. With this water, the lad revives all those who have been pushed by fate to pass by.
Then they heated an oven, they heated it nine times, and when they threw the old woman in there, it was ashes!
And behold, the young men returned to the king, and the newcomer came, and the king came down from his throne, and set the two young men in their places. And the young men divided the kingdom among themselves, and brought their fathers here, and they are still living, if they are not dead.
That's how it was!
HANDSOME, CLEVER...
There once was a lad - handsome as the sun, as phallic as a cypress and as brave as a lion. He was just in the prime of life. One day, as he passed through a forest, he came upon an old woman. The old woman, seeing him so handsome, said to herself, "I need this."
- "You old man," said the old woman, "I'm going to do you a favor.
The lad stopped, and the old woman again:
- You beautiful, clever boy, you get in this hole, and you'll be pissing in a room. In the hall I give three rooms; in one is a dog with an eye as big as a glass mouth. You shall call out to him, "You clever, clever boy," and then, quietly, take him down from his crate and get as much money as you can carry.
Then go into the other room; and there you find a dog - with eyes as big as millstones; say to him, "You clever, clever boy!", then take him off the crate, unlock the crate and take as much money as you want.
Finally, he enters the third floor. You'll come across a dog as huge as you've seen in years. You do the same, as before, with the other dogs - and again you load yourself with the balls of your heart's desire. Amongst that money you see you come across an amnar! Take it and bring it to me at once, or I'll leave you down there!
The falconic lad, fearless of nothing, wastes no time, but comes down on the spot, tied by a belt, and arrives in the room in question. As the old woman had taught him, so he did: he called the dog "handsome, clever one", took him down from the treasure, and loaded himself with brass.
He went into the other room. And so on: "handsome, clever," he waddled past the dog with eyes as big as millstones, lowered him from the treasure where he was perched, and filled his breast with silver money.
Then he goes into the big doghouse. With a "nice, clever", he took this one down, too, and took - now gold money - as much as he could carry. He closed the door nicely behind him, and went out of the room, he remembered he had forgotten to take the amnion. He shook him by the waist, to draw it out, and, when he was upstairs, asked the old woman:
- What about the amnesty, did you bring it?
- No, Grandma, forget him! You forgot, because all I could think about was those damn bucks.
- If so," said the old woman, "here, until you bring me the amnaro (there was something about this amnaro that the old woman wanted it so badly!) - you can't see the light!
And he let go of the back strap.
Not long after, here's the big guy again, now with the amnesty.
But, when he was going to give it to the old lady, he had the nerve to want to know why she needed it!
He - "tell me", the old lady - "don't tell you", the big man gets very angry with the old lady, pulls the sword out of its sheath and takes her head. Once he'd done that, he wasn't late for the scene. He's going who knows where! When he got there, he left quickly, with friends, with women, that he had no money left in his purse.
He was sitting there one day, upset because he didn't feel like doing anything, and he thought of lighting a cigarette. He took out his ammo to dig, he took a drag, and then the dog with an eye the size of a glass appeared - in a soul.
- What do you command, my lord?
- What do I command you?" said the big man, who rubbed his eyes in wonder: "Money, money, money!
He doesn't even have time to say it, and lo and behold - the dog goes, and in the blink of an eye brings a whole sack of brass money to his feet.
After chopping them down to one, he escaped with the amnion, striking twice, and the dog with eyes like millstones showed up.
- Command, my lord, said this one.
- Lovele I want, lovele!
And, likewise, before you turn around once, he brought her a bag of silver.
Only the bullock melts them quickly, in a few days. And again he runs to Amnar, his escape. Trac!, once, trac! - on the count of three, here comes Baliuca, the fiercest of the hounds.
- Command, Lord!
As much as you could spit - the Baliuca hound returned with a bag full of coins.
What did the lad think then? I have money now, plenty of it. I don't miss a thing. What I do miss is my wife!
With that much money, sure - you find a wife, and a beautiful one at that!
There lived, by the place, an emperor. Who had a daughter - I can't tell you how beautiful his daughter was. That's why he kept her, so she wouldn't get hurt, he kept her under twelve keys. Our lad, when he heard about this girl, he was all hot for her and swore he'd either take her or he'd never take her again!
Well, but how to do, to fix it? Come on, back to the amnar! He's flinting it, and there they are, the dogs, all at once. And he orders them to bring him the Emperor's daughter at once, otherwise it's impossible!
The dogs also rushed towards the palaces of the lordship, to tear them down, and not another! The emperor thundered, called his army to battle. You've found your quarrel! Keys, gates - they leapt from their places, and, in a minute - the beautiful daughter of the king was in the arms of the strongman!
The next day, the lad sent the girl back to the Emperor and asked him to give her to him willingly, or else - the fault would not be his.
Well, he only wants it if you don't give it to him!
Then they had a royal wedding, and the king, seeing how his son-in-law was so close to him, came down from his throne and made the young man king, and he did not meddle in the affairs of the kingdom any more, but was content to draw quietly from his throne.
That was it, and - cheers to all!
THE WOMAN WITH THREE SONS - AND THE MERCHANT
Once upon a time, as never before, if it wasn't - there was no story.
Once there was a poor, poor woman who had three sons. She was so poor she didn't even have enough to feed them.
One day, a merchant came by and kept shouting:
- Which of your boys do you have, to take on apprentices?
The poor woman came out of the gate and called him:
- Hey, man! You looking for boys?
- Me!
- If I give you mine, will you take it?
- Why shouldn't I take it!
And he let his eldest son go, and the woman got her money.
The merchant took the boy and wanted to climb the diamond mountain.
On this mountain, no one could climb. How could the merchant make it up and get the boy up? He sewed him up into a skin and threw him on some rubbish. There the ravens and hawks gathered and - pull one, pull another by the leather sack, until they dragged him up the diamond mountain. The boy, after the crows had torn the skin, also got out of the sack and began to gather diamonds. Then the merchant called out to him:
- Hey, big boy, throw me the diamonds!
And the boy filled a big sack and threw it away.
- Now, let the dogs eat you there, you unfortunate man," said the shopkeeper. Stay upstairs until you starve to death!
He took his bag, the merchant, and went about his business.
The next day, he showed up in the village again, shouting the same thing:
- Which of your boys do you have, to take on apprentices?
That poor woman also came out of the house, and said that she had.
The merchant took the second boy and made him like the first. And again on her way through the village, and as soon as the poor woman saw and heard him, she gave her the third son, whom she still had, it's true - with a heavy heart that she was parting with this one too, but - what did she say to herself: rather than to me - and let them starve to death, better far away, so that they too might get enlightened.
The merchant did with the little one what he had done with the older ones, except that the priest - as soon as he reached the mountain with diamonds, instead of precious stones, he threw him clean stones. But he threw them, no joke - he killed him with them!
Then he turned the mountain upside down, and in a ravine somewhere, he found his brothers, dead and dying. When he had wept enough to tear your soul, he bent over them, still remembering all the troubles he'd had together, he wiped his eyes and went where his feet would take him. And he came to an orchard of beauty. In that orchard there was a fountain with water as clear as tears, and a shady, bushy tree stretched its branches over it. And what do you think? In the fountain bathed three fairies - all three of them - to take their heads and run with them, not another!
The little girl just saw them and lost her head, they were so beautiful. And he decided what to do, and to fix them, just to keep them in his hands. He snuck up to them and took their shirts. The fairies didn't notice him at all, but when they were out of sight - take the shirts here, take them there, take them where they aren't!
- If you search for them by tomorrow, he calls out to them - and you still can't find them! The shirts are here, with me: first resurrect my brothers and then I'll see if I can give them to you.
Fairies, what can they do, they have no choice! Not that, but whatever he asked, they would do, and into the fire they would jump - if he told them to jump. That being the case, they immediately resurrected the youngest's brothers. And yet you found him giving them their shirts one by two, poor fairies!
- You're going with us! - he asked them, and like it or not, the fairies went with them, like little lambs... The boys did a lot of work, too much, they had diamonds of ninety-nine kinds. Their mother, when she saw them so burdened with money, her joy!
All of them, but her daughters-in-law - as if from the stars they had descended! When they'll see her in church, with such daughters-in-law, what a fudge! The world will go mad with jealousy. She couldn't get under her skin with joy, and she kept crossing herself and saying:
- Blessed be that Christian who takes my children away from me, that they have become what I did not expect!
- Mother, mother, leave the blessings, said the youngest, that your Christian was not only a man of humanity, for only goodness did not want us, and learn about the girls - that we have not married them, so get ready to get married!
And a wedding began - from Thursday to Thursday - to which, who did they not call, and what goodness did they not have in abundance? And there were great lords with the king of that country himself at the head of the table, happy that he had lived long enough to see such a wedding and such brides! And there was no lack of the most precious of all the good things, as if God had given them everything for this wedding with both hands!
And they rejoiced, and they rejoiced - as they pleased! And after each had played at the head of the hore, "Let the brides enter into the horde" - so suddenly the king thundered. But the brides were in a queue, for, you see, their shirts were missing.
- Well, that's a good one! said the king, put them on now!
Prîslea, what was in his head - he took out and gave them the shirts, like a fool! He dressed them, the fairies, and they set on a game, to shred, no other. And when the bride and groom were marvelling the more, And racing one after another to honour the lute-men with a more precious yellow,- The fairies sprang up, took flight,- And still they go!
And so the poor boys were left with swollen lips on the bride's side. And so, having plenty of money, they took other girls, also of Christian stock.
I was at their wedding too - and I played, and I broke my saddle! Now - let the others bounce, before I catch my breath.
THE HORN
It was - what wasn't:
There once was an old woman and an old-
Baba and the old man had a chicken and a rooster.
They fell ill with quarrels and couldn't live together, so they decided to separate. And so they did.
All their house and wealth were - the hen and the rooster.
The hen got the hen and the rooster got the rooster.
The rooster, in a row, scurrying in the garbage for food, what does it come across? A yellow! He picks it up and carries it to the old man. And as he walks along, the son of the king comes out. And when he saw him with the yellow in his pliscus, what did he think? "He's stealing it from us, otherwise who could have it?" That's what he said, and he took it from him. He took it, but he got into trouble with the rooster, because he didn't fall for it. He climbed up on the garbage and started to say:
- Cucurigu...! The son of the crane took my yellow!
- What an ass," said the king, "isn't he ashamed to lie like that? Well, shall we take the yellow from him?
But the king commanded: "Catch him for me and throw him into the yellow pit, let him swallow, let him swallow - until he gets fed up and slaps it, so that he can see that we don't pay for a yellow".
They threw him into the cesspool and swallowed the rooster by the gallons, so that there was no more room in the pipe. When the men of the crane came to see if he had given up the ghost, they had just opened the door and he flew out. He goes to the old man and says:
- Old man, hang me from the beam, put a silk veil on me, take a golden rod and beat me until I say: enough!
The old man did just that. He put the rod on him, - na! and na! until he heard the rooster say, "Enough!" When, what do you know? On the ground, my brother - pennies and pennies! The old man couldn't get under his skin with joy.
The next day, the rooster goes out to the garbage again and starts again:
- Cucurigu, cucurigu! - the son of the king takes my yellow!
When they were in the courtyard, the king cried out:
- Hey, asshole! Isn't he ashamed to lie like that? Yesterday, all day long he swallowed his pennies in the cesspool, and he still can't get enough! Now he's screaming for everyone to hear, so we can't stick our heads out!
That's what the king said, and he gave orders to catch the rooster again and throw him into the herd, to kill the mares, to crush him in his hooves. But you've found your rooster to care so much! As soon as he saw himself among the mares, he began, on his tongue:
- Cucuriguuuu! - come wolf, come fox to eat the mares of the lion.
And - "cucurigu-cucurigu..." - here is the wolf, here is the fox, who did not wait to be called twice, and they also rushed at the mares, - hap!, hap!, one after the other swallowing them, so that there was not a leg left in the whole herd.
And again the rooster stretches it towards the palace of the king. The river comes out and stops him in his tracks.
- Duck, duck, says the rooster, get out of the way, he's waiting for me at home.
- Well, sure, says the river. I can't wait for you!
- You river, make way for me, you river, for the lizard will know you!
And he said one thing, the river another - they fell and: bang, the river, bang! and the rooster, the river fell, the rooster proved. Then the rooster took hold and drank up the whole river, and left not a drop. And then, in no time, the rooster is back on the garbage heap!
And again, in his own language:
- Cucuriguuu! - the son of the king took my yellow!
- You shameless ass," says the king, "you haven't done enough to me, and you still curse me! Seize him, he demanded, and burn him in the oven, I'll see him burn!
They heated the oven nine times and threw the rooster in there to burn him alive. But you found your rooster, burn him! The little rascal yawned two or three times and - what do you know? The furnace, the palace - they perished under the water, there's no stone left here.
From now on, the rooster and the old man sat on the hatch.
One day, what's on Santa's mind? - to measure his yellow. But, having no measure, he asks for the old lady's bucket. But the bucket was dirty with tar on the bottom, and when the old man handed it to the old woman, she didn't notice that a yellow had stuck to the bucket.
- That's right," said the old lady, "did you measure out the bucket?
- Eh," said the old man, "I thought I wouldn't tell you, but since you found out, well, that's true...
- Okay, but what's the big deal?
- How the hell! Long live my rooster, he brought it to me.
- But how did you bring it to you?
- How can I do it, said the old man, - I gave him a good piece of paper and sent him to drain the garbage. When he came back, I hung him from the beam, and I beat him again with a golden rod: burn him, burn him, until he filled my house with gold.
The old woman wanted to do like her father: she gave the hen a good beating and sent her to the garbage. On the way back, he burned a few more - and the poor hen gave up the ghost.
The old woman, left alone and without fortune, begged the old man to take her in - so that she could have a kitchen and not starve.
The old man's heart was breaking with pity for his grandmother, and - come on, he called her to him, God willing, and he has something to eat and something for her to wear.
And look - it did.
THE SON OF AN EMPEROR WHO DIES AND RISES AGAIN
Once upon a time - never seen again!
There was once an emperor. This emperor also had an empress.
This queen, whenever God gave her children, gave birth only to daughters. Now the empress was heavy again, just as the emperor went to war. When he was parting from his family at home, he left word with his mother and commanded her thus:
- My mother, if my wife gives birth to a son, you must let me know; if it is a girl again, you must not let me know, because it will be difficult for me.
And the sorrow came, and God had mercy, and gave the queen a son. The emperor's mother - by a handful she grew, so glad was she, to see a man's cross in so many daughters. They had waited for the boy like a ripe cherry. And the mother-in-law said to her daughter-in-law:
- My daughter, our dear Emperor commanded me, on my departure, to inform him, if you give birth to a boy and if it's a girl, no.
The Empress was very angry to hear this:
- No! she said, as if I liked giving birth to girls? What could I do if God sent them to me? I don't understand why the Emperor puts all the blame on me!
And, annoyed, the empress did not want to tell the emperor that this time she had a son.
The boy grew taller and more handsome every day, and in his own time he started going to school. But at Christmas, at Easter, all the children, all his playmates, told each other what their fathers had brought them, only he was silent, poor thing; he sat shut up inside, what to say, knowing he had no father. One day, on the eve of the holidays, he heard the children boasting about what their parents had brought them, and he had a hard time, he ran away from school and went to his mother's house and asked her like this:
His mother didn't want to talk to him about it at first, so as not to upset him, but eventually she did:
- Mother dear, you have a father too, but that's just the way it is: your father went off to war, just when you were born. And, I don't know what came over him, to ask us to let him know only and only if he had a boy. And I was angry with him, because he threw me a letter from God, and I didn't send him a letter when you were born. He, after waiting as long as he waited, that war being over, went on and on - and gone he was. I weep for him too, and would like to see him again, but I can't.
The boy was not one of those who are afraid of their shadow, or a dickhead like so many. He was a good fart, and when he set his mind to something, he wouldn't rest until he saw it done.
Having heard from his mother, he went to look for a companion with whom he could go after his aunt. He found one his own age and took him on. His mother, like all loving mothers, did not want to let him go, - that he was bad among strangers, and it was hard, that he would get lost there, that some girl would blow his head off if he stayed far away, who knows where, - and what she would do without a son. And many other things the poor mother said, but she couldn't get him out of his own; he kept on holding her, that "I'm going," and no one could persuade him!
What can the unfortunate mother say, - she left him to his own devices.
- Go, my dear, if you can't otherwise, but - let me make a mark, here, on your hand, on your right arm, so your father knows you.
And off the two friends went, off into the wide world. And on they went, and on they went, till they were parched with thirst. When a deserted well came into their path, in a deserted field, where there was no sign of man. Just the two of them. But who could go down into it for water, for the well had no water. One said, "You go in," the other, "You go in," - they drew lots at last, and the emperor's son fell in. The latter took off his hat and, having nothing to drink, filled it. His companion, a sly but clever boy, asked him to drink first. The emperor's son obliged. Only, that bastard, after drinking, slammed the lid over the fountain's mouth!
The emperor's son thought that the king's son was just playing around, and that he was just joking, so that they could laugh too, and he told him:
- Come on! - Enough playing around, and let me go, because we're going to be here at night and we'll stay out here, unguarded.
- I won't let you go," said the little rascal, "until you pass me the mark on your right arm that your mother left you.
The emperor's son realised that the joke was over and that this was no joke. What could he do? Drink, Grigore, the holy water!
- Let me out, let me out, he shouted, I'll give you the sign!
And he took it out, and gave it to her, through a crack.
- I still won't open the door," said the kingmaker, "until you swear to me and swear again that you, from this moment on, will be the kingmaker and I - the son of an emperor.
And the son of the emperor bound himself with an oath, and said:
- I swear again and again, that you are henceforth the son of an emperor, and I, your fellow traveller - to die and live, and only then to tell my father the truth!
The firstborn was a dog, what shall I say, a roadside gatherer, a sort of flower child.
If he took this oath, hard as a mountain of stone, he lifted the lid, and out came the emperor's son, yellow as wax cake: he'd done it, poor fellow, he'd got it up his sleeve - brave as he was.
Well, my dears, and bravery, to show it, you need a suitable occasion.
After that, they went away again, and asking man to man, they found out where the king was. And they sent word to him to meet them, that they had news from his native place.
The emperor welcomes them with joy, but he did not know who his son was. For the king's son, as he had bound himself by oath, said that the prince was a son of the king, and that he was only his companion. Then the father and the lying son kissed and embraced, and entered the palace.
The next day dawn broke. The first-born sat down, foot on foot, and looked out into the garden. He saw flowers there, so much grass - to marvel! And he liked a rose, and asked his companion - the emperor's son, to bring it to him.
- No," said the king, "no one may enter there, because a two-headed dragon guards it. This dragon knows only me - that I am the master of the garden, and the gardener, who tends and waters the garden. Let the gardener go and fetch your flower.
They told the emperor's son to order the gardener to cut a rose. The king's son asked for the gardener, but if he could not find him on the spot, he went into the garden. Little did he know that he would come across a two-headed dragon there. Only - this dragon was a mischievous one. Just seeing him, he knew he was the son of an emperor, he didn't touch him, and said:
- Pretty boy, open your mouth...
The boy opened his mouth and the two-headed dragon spat into it, and the boy thought he knew all the languages of the world. He now knew how sparrows, swallows, all the birds, all the animals in the world spoke. Then he picked some roses and brought them to the priest. He looked through the window at the king's son, to see him swallowed by the two-headed dragon, and was astonished when he saw him escape unharmed.
The first-born - my children, if he has been given all sorts of things, he begins to think that this is how he's always been. Only one worry was on his mind: how to get rid of the emperor's son, how to make him break his neck in some way, because he was standing in his way! He was worried that the truth might come out one day. And what he was afraid of, he never got rid of.
One day, the emperor was sitting at the table with the king. The emperor's son, standing, carried them food, poured them to wash, robotically, robotically. In the meantime, here come two swallows and chip-cricket, chip-cricket, they were quarrelling over a scrap of drunk: one wanted to take it, and the other wouldn't let him. As the king's son understood their speech, he laughed that they could quarrel over such a thing. The prince thought he was laughing at himself and complained to the king:
- Can you believe it, Dad, the way this poor guy laughs at us?
The emperor was furious, how such a nobody could laugh at him and his son, and commanded him to ruin him! The emperor's son-in-law, seeing that they were making a mess of things, told them why he was laughing:
- But do not sin against me, for I do not laugh at you, but at these swallows, who quarrel over a scrap of drunkenness, torn from the veil of the daughter of the Brave-Emperor - from the land of the birds.
- If it is as you say," said the rash man, "go and fetch me the Brave's daughter - from that land of birds, to be my bride.
The boyfriend was hoping to lose the boy, because he wasn't that married.
The emperor's son, hearing this, had his mind clouded in his head! How to do and how to fix it? He goes to the two-headed dragon and tells him his trouble, and asks his advice.
- Don't be scared, said the two-headed dragon, I won't let you, man carry together whatever comes. Go and tell the emperor to make you two coats of clothes, sewn with gold thread, and to give you a bag of coins, with which we can deceive the emperor's daughter.
The boy asks all these things of the king, who gives them to him. Then he set off with the two-headed dragon, and - in the twinkling of an eye, the dragon lit a hair on fire, called a flying horse, jumped on his back, and to the palace of the Brave-Emperor they came! The handsome son-in-law of the emperor, as soon as the day was breaking, put on silks and went to the palace. His robes, on which the sun's rays fell, shone so bright that they caught your eyes. The girl saw him and was very surprised, - who could it be?
So one day, so two, until the third, when the boy decides to go and ask for the girl.
- Brave king," he said, "may we be forgiven, but I have come to give my daughter as a bride. And by speech, by bearing, our handsome prince had the face of a great lord's son, the son of a king's bone.
Said the emperor:
- Son, you're nice, you're handsome, you may be of good breeding, but I still won't give you the girl until you find me some water.
In those days, you see, there was also eau-vie. The boy asked for a day's thought, and then barely gave his answer.
- I'll give you two," said the emperor, "because the days are not in the bag.
The king's son runs to the two-headed dragon for advice. And the dragon told him that only the master of the birds could do this job.
Fugue - the son of an emperor to the greatest of birds! And since he knew their language, he quickly got along with them. The king of the birds summoned all the winged ones on earth, and asked them which of them knew where the water-life flowed. Nobody knew! But when the little bird counted, it was clear that someone was missing.
- Call her, said the big birdie, she should come too, maybe you know something.
- But what's the good of it, she's also lame and with a broken wing, said a little bird, how will she know that?
- It's nothing," said the Emperor of Birds, "the question doesn't hurt.
And, wonder! - that's exactly what he knew. They tied a warp around his neck and, crawl crawl! - he went and fetched some brandy. The emperor's son took it and gave it to the brave emperor:
- There you go! You asked me for brandy, I gave you brandy. What else do you want?
- My handsome, my good man, hold on, I want more; trouble is just ahead; I have a barn full of wheat, corn, millet, oats, and many other varieties of seed; I want you to pick them all by dawn tomorrow.
And, again, run to the two-headed dragon to see how he does.
- Don't worry, this isn't hard work either. Go to the Ant-king, for only he and his people can help you.
The son of an emperor runs and searches and searches until he finds the ant hill. The son of the ant-emperor had just gone for a walk in the fresh air. Prince Charming reached out and caught him.
- I won't give him to you alive, he said, because I need this and this from you!
- Well, spare the Ant-king's little son, it's easy what you want from us.
And so all the ants poured into the barn, and - which wheat he picked, which corn, the millet, - by dawn, grain by grain, in special heaps, everything was ready.
- Well," said the handsome prince-son of an emperor, "I did that too, what else is there?
The valiant king of the land of the birds understood that the son of an emperor had achieved all this because the dragon had advised him. And having such a kite in his palace, he said:
- Only then do you take the girl from me, when your dragon has to fight mine and prove it!
And again the king's son runs to his two-headed dragon, and tells him that he is in great danger: "So and so he still wants, Brave King." Only the boy's dragon was someone, not a joke:
- Don't worry, he said. Just go and get me twelve mats and twelve belts. Lay them one on top of the other, the mats, and tighten them with the straps over the middle.
The boy did as the two-headed dragon taught him. Then the dragon said to the emperor's son:
- Take good care - if you see that I'm hot, you know that I'm hot and I need you to blow me, to cool me down; if I'm not hot, don't let your head hurt, I'll eat your kale!
And where, my brother, were the two dragon-men, like two fairies, that poured fire and brimstone out of their mouths; when the dragon of the Emperor-Brave took hold of him with his teeth, the dragon of the Emperor's son, he tore off a mat from him; but when the dragon of the Emperor's son stuck his fangs in, he tore off strips of flesh! Yet the other was a dragon's dog, and he pulled with iron teeth. And they fought, and fought - summer day, till evening, from dawn till sunset.
That's when the boy feels a kind of booming coming from his dragon. This meant joy, for he had defeated his enemy.
The brave king could do nothing more and left his daughter!
- Take it, he said to Prince Charming, and be happy with it!
What can I tell you next? On the one hand, the emperor was having a hard time parting with his beloved daughter, but on the other hand he was happy that he had found his daughter a mate. He could have waited all he wanted, and he still couldn't find one like this boy - as if he had come down from the stars. They had their big wedding, and the next day the young people left. When they left, the girl didn't forget to take her water-glass with her, so that on the way they might find themselves in good times or bad.
When they approached their village, Prince Charming told the girl what and how, and that she had been ordained for another, for a great lord's son; but the girl - she would hear of no other!
- My father married me to you, I'll be yours, I won't hear of anyone else!
He hears that the boy has returned, and is astonished, - what a way, this man escapes from where you do not expect!
The couple arrived at the palace and there the bride did not want to show herself to anyone or speak to anyone except the emperor's son who had brought her. And she was beautiful, unhappy - to sip it in a glass of water! The first time he saw her, his heels were on fire; he was helpless. And, seeing that he paid no attention, he complained to the emperor:
- Dad, while this dog of a companion of mine is alive, the bride will still be upset, because who knows what he has put in her way, to twist her mind.
The emperor made a sign at once, and the whirlwinds rushed at the boy and tore him to pieces! Only then the bride came out to see what was going on.
- You see, father," said the hasty one, "that it was because of him that he was not going out? You see now you're going out?
He was happy to be rid of the emperor's son. Little did he know - woe to him - what awaited him, and that trouble was just beginning for him!
The bride showed herself, but still wouldn't speak to him. That's all she said: "Gather his flesh in a sack and bring him to me to see him again, then I will speak."
They indulged him. She began to lay out his body parts, each in its own place, and poured over them, from the urinal, some eau-vie. The flesh moved once, twice, and a third time - here he stands, alive, as you see me and I see you! They were all speechless and staring, seeing such a wonder!
- I've slept badly! said Prince Charming.
- It wasn't sleep, you wretch, it was death! said the bride and told him what had happened.
Then the king's son loosed his tongue from the oath he had sworn, and spoke:
- Glory be to you, O glorious emperor, glory be to you, O glorious emperor, know that this is how it is. Your son is me. He's a gypsy's son, the son of the village fortune-teller, whom you took as my companion. But you saw what he was capable of.
And the emperor's son told of all that had happened, with a beautiful chartreuse, - how he went down into the well, how he was shut in, how he took the sign from his mother, how he made him swear an oath not to say that he was the emperor's son...
- Why, father," said the emperor's son, "I have sworn to die and to rise again, and only then to say. Now that I am risen, I am no longer bound by the oath - and can speak the pure truth.
The gypsy-prisoner began to shake like a wart, his teeth chattering in fear, unrepentant, when he saw the miracle.
They then grabbed him, tied him to four wild horses, and when they slapped him on the back, the sashes made him!
Then the king came down from the throne, and put his son in his place, and with great joy he sent and brought the queen to him, and the two kingdoms became one.
I was also welcomed there, and I bought you a red belt from the market, but on the way back, through the Daucati slum, the dogs came after me, and ham-ham, to tear me not another! I had nothing to defend myself with, so I defended myself with my girdles. One dog by the waist, another, they tore them from me, to be worn by their dogs!
There it was!
ANDRIES AND THE HARP
Once upon a time, in a time long ago, there was a lad, Andrei. He, after getting married, went away to earn some money. But, as it happens among strangers, that today - that tomorrow something would be added, days passed, weeks became weeks, weeks became months and months became years, and so, year by year - fourteen were made in his head. After fourteen years, he wanted to go home and see his wife and his dear parents after so long.
Setting out from among the strangers, he made the sign of the cross - may the Lord bring him safely - and got into the ship. Haida-haida, the ship approached the border of their village. The captain of the ship shouted for everyone to get off, for they had paid up to now. They all got out, and Andrei got off.
And he went home, glad that God had willed that he should see his parents and his wife in good health. When suddenly, a cursed black as a sheet came his way and said:
- What can I get you, good news?
- Well, what can I give you?
- Will you give me anything?" said the Harp.
- Okay, fine," said Andrei.
- Good luck, the woman gave birth to your son! You don't know you left her heavy when you left. He's mine now!
On the spot, Andrei's face changed, how the impious one pushed him to bind himself to give him the child! He was walking home, his head bowed, and he kept thinking how he would get rid of Harap! He thought that at home, like all shepherds, there would be dogs. Dogs "save me the trouble" - he thought. Then to Harap:
He before him, the Harp after him, they came into Andrew's court. Baliuca, an old shepherd dog, as soon as he saw him, also met his master and began to guild around him. The other dogs did the same. But the harpy didn't dare go beyond the gate.
Andrei, when he saw his boy, big and handsome, a strong man - hang his sword around his waist, cried out to Harap:
- Come, Harape, come and get it!
- Bring him here, said the Harp.
Only when the dogs heard his voice - and suddenly they pounced on him, because the Harp didn't know how to get out of their paws!
Not long after that, the children came out of school one day with their teachers to walk around the village. With them was Andrei's son, Andries, as his playmates called him.
As he was playing near the shore, Andries spotted a beautiful fish, the likes of which he had never seen before. The fish was only near the shore, where the water was shallow. Andries blew out his fins, went into the water and kept trying to catch it. But the fish, the damn fish, here you thought he'd catch it, here he dropped it through his fingers.
And lo and behold, it was getting dark and the shadows began to grow. The teacher gathered his children to go with them to the village. When he set off, he counted them and one less came out. "Who's missing?" "Andries," someone said. "There he is, chasing fish."
The teacher calls out to him, that he's leaving; that one, over there:
- One more titty, to catch a fish.
They went and left him there. The fish, as soon as he saw this, jumped out of the water and changed into a man. This was the real devil, in the flesh, as you see me and as I see you, with horns three palms long and a tail three cubits long. The boy didn't have time to say piss! The devil even grabbed him and took him to his palace in the middle of the sea. He was the very Harp that had come out to Andrew the father on his way back from the big world.
This devil had a father and a mother. In the palace there was also an emperor's daughter, kidnapped by them, as beautiful as the moon in the sky and as good as a maid.
The boy was brought to the room where the emperor's daughter was. He began to weep, - for what could he do there, but he also wept for joy, to be locked up with such a beautiful girl. She asked him:
- Why are you crying? Don't you see, I'm a girl and I don't cry, and you, a man of the law, to go to pieces like that?
The boy blushed, wiped his tears and said:
- Beautiful, how can I not cry? Can't you see the misery I'm in?
- It's okay, you'll learn, like I did.
The boy also fell silent.
The devils, father, mother and son, used to leave towards evening, when it was getting dark. And so tonight. But, they had told the boy before:
- Check this out! Tomorrow morning, as-necessum, let there be a vine stump here, with a bunch of grapes, - otherwise, you know that little pieces make you! I'll eat you and not another!" said the old devil.
As they left, the poor boy's tears came again. But the girl said to him again:
- Why are you crying to ruin your eyes?
- How can I not weep, beautiful world, the Harpy threatens me that if I don't bring him a vine stump with grapes by dawn tomorrow, grown here, he will eat me, woe is me!
- Oh! You fool, what do you care? Go and see that old man who works there, in the middle of the sea, and shout at him like this: "Grandpa, grandpa! Your father told me that by tomorrow morning there must be a vine with grapes, if you don't want the Harpy to swallow it!"
The poor boy went over and shouted as the girl had taught him. The old man said to him, "All right, go on, and tomorrow at dawn there'll be that vineyard with grapes at the Harap."
When the devils returned early in the morning, they found there what they had commanded. The Mother of the Harp took the grapes and ate them - they were in her throat!
The next evening, on their departure, the three drummers told the boy again:
- Tomorrow morning let a bigger palace than ours appear here, otherwise you're finished!
The boy was thinking again, and what thoughts! Only the emperor's daughter was still around... He sent him back to his old man to say, "Grandfather, grandfather, your father sent me to tell you that a palace must be built at the Harap's by tomorrow, bigger than his, or else the Harap will swallow it."
- Well, well, said the old man, go and tomorrow morning is as you say.
When they came back again, they saw the palace and were amazed.
Okay, but the Harapul is looking for a reason to eat Andries. Therefore, and the next evening, when he was leaving, the devils said to him:
- Tomorrow let's see a river that runs through the sea, or you're finished!
The girl, hearing the new commandment of the stonemasons, which could only come out of the heads of devils, was frightened and said to the boy:
- You beautiful dear boy, this is no joke... but you know what I say? Let's go from here wherever we can see, and we'll somehow end up in your village!
- Let's go, said the boy, but who knows the way back?
- Do not be troubled, for He who is above does not let us perish.
The girl took with her a comb, a bottle of oil and a mirror - and they made themselves invisible from there.
When the dawn breaks, the devils knock at the palace gates to open them, but who can open them? They jumped over the wall, looked through all the rooms, - no sign of a girl, no sign of a boy.
The devils come back out and see the fugitives running. They set off on a mad dash to catch up. When the girl and the boy saw that the devils were catching up with them, and were about to seize them, they threw the comb behind them, and there was a high and rugged mountain, all thorns and brambles though, just like the teeth of a comb.
And again the fugitives flee away, and again the devils run away, and they slice the brush with their mouths, make their way, cross over the mountain and - ready to catch them.
If they saw and saw, the young men also threw back the mirror, and there came up, my God, a mountain so long, that it was a devil's bane to climb it.
The girl and the boy were now well away, but the Harp still reached them. Then the girl also threw the oil jug. On the spot there was a puddle of cold water, as cold as cold can be.
The fugitives changed into ducks and went down into the sweet water to lose their trail.
The devils have got him, and the old man - Harap's father, he said, bitterly:
Oh, come on. Just you,
sun and light,
I found you at sea,
I fed you honey, -
and leave us?
The girl and the boy pretended not to hear and squealed like frogs: "bac! bac! bac! bac! bac!"
Then said the Harpy, the old son of a bitch:
- Go! Was it not you, that we found you at sea, and dressed you in fine gowns, and brought you everything you desired, and now you are leaving us?
The girl and Andreiaș again:
- Bac-bac-bac-bac! Bac-bac-bac-bac!
At last, said the Harp's mother:
- Didn't we rescue you from the sea, and raise you, and make you all the sails, and now you leave us?
- Bac-bac-bac-bac! bac-bac-bac-bac! - the runners shouted again.
Then the mother of the devil turned and said, cursing:
- Let his mother kiss him and forget his wife! She knew what she was saying.
At that moment the roosters crowed, and the devils went whirling away. The girl and the boy came out of the pond to go to his house. On the way, she said to him:
- Did you hear what the little lady said! Mind you, Andrius, don't let your mother kiss you, and tell her why, if she's insisting.
- Okay, the boy says.
Andres left his wife in a hut in the mountains, because he was ashamed - daughter of an emperor - to bring her back to the village with her clothes in tatters, because they got ragged on the way.
He went but the boy home alone to make him a pair of clothes.
And, as he had promised, he did not let his mother kiss him:
- Mother, don't kiss me, I'm married!
His mother, like any mother - she wanted to kiss him, because she hadn't seen him for a long time and now the boy was as if he was from another world! But she still didn't kiss him.
But in the middle of the night, when the boy was fast asleep, his mother went to him to look at him. When she saw him, sweating and exhausted, for he alone knew how far he had walked, she wiped away his sweat and kissed him with joy. The boy felt nothing. At dawn, he got up, washed himself and lay down on the bed.
His mother asked him:
- Dear boy, you were saying last night that you got married, - when are you bringing your bride here to your parents?
Andreiaș had forgotten all about it after her mother had kissed him:
- What bride?
- The one you were talking about yesterday!
- You're wrong, Mother - I'm not married.
Then his mother did what she did and engaged him to a girl from the village. And the other one, poor thing, kept waiting in the mountains for him to pick her up.
The wedding feast is coming. Suddenly, just as the young people were about to put the crown on their heads, two doves sent by the other girl came and sat down, one on the head of the bridegroom and the other on the head of the bride. The one on the bride's head began to coo, saying:
- Did I not, my dear fellow, rescue you from the claws of the Harpy with my many crafts? Did you not tell me and swear to me that you would rather die and perish than part with me, and now you want to marry another?
Hearing this, Andries pushed the bride from beside him, breaking away from her, and said:
- I'm married, I'm married! Leave me alone, what do you want - to marry me off to another?
Then Andres went to his bride in the mountains, and brought her home and made her his wife.
And I was there too, and I was taking some gifts, to bring them to you, but as I was passing by a canyon, some frogs were yelling, as they do - "bac-bac-bac" (oac-oac-oac) and I thought the Turks were going to burst in and shout - "brac! brac! brac!" - and I got scared and dropped the gifts and ran away!...
LUCEFERII
Once upon a time - never seen again!
He was once a filthy rich king. His wealth - who else knew? God had left him with everything. Only one thing he lacked: children. So willed the One above, that he should not be a man on earth without a nail in his heart.
The unhappy king, when he was thinking of the years that go by and go by, and when he thought that the rope is getting tighter and shorter, and that soon it will be time to give the king his funeral - he was shivering. It was not death he feared - for no one escapes that - but he was afraid that with him his lineage would die out, that he would leave no heir to bear his name, and that no one would raise smoke over his house.
After a while, the poor little boy began to beat rosaries at the icon, and to pray to God, the Good:
- Give me, Lord, a soul too - and let it be a goat!
God was merciful, and gave him a daughter, but with goatskin.
The crane took it as it came. He received her with an open heart, he even haggled for a woman to see her, and he was fond of her, and looked at her as a real girl. Now his soul trembled for ... this goat, more than for all that God had given him.
Only, the girl wasn't the goat... Only during the day, when she was wearing her goatskin, she looked like that. In the evening, when she undressed, she was more beautiful than the fairies in the stories, so much so that even Ileana Cosânzeana was more beautiful!
I don't know how it happened - for in my fairy tale it is not shown - but the daughter of the king saw a handsome young man in great need; the girl took the lad to heart, and no other! He would not eat, he would not drink, he would not sleep, for he was always thinking of her.
When it was his turn to marry, the son of an emperor - for that was the young man - began to be presented with the daughters of kings, emperors, and great lords - beautiful as they were, and with all the gifts of the world; but in vain the lad would not even look at them.
After he had gone around like this, who knows how many leading housewives' daughters, who knows how many rare beauties, and sent them all away, the boy was picked up by his aunt:
- What are you up to, son? All that pride in girls - not liking any of them? Great wonder! That's it, where else? Close your eyes and choose one, or we'll have some craftsmen at the factory.
- Father," said the boy, "the girl is chosen, but I'm afraid you won't mind making her your daughter-in-law.
- You can choose a piglet, my dear, - you'll live with it! As a parent, I'd like to see you happy, that's why I opened your eyes. But do as you please.
At these words, the lad sort of turned from corner to corner, and said in a washed voice:
- Father, all my love, all my thoughts I have given to the goat of the lion!
- You wretched child - among so many faces like icons, like stars in the sky - have you found your goat to fall dear to you? Or do you want to blacken my soul and rob me of all life's joys? Are you going to bury me with days? Why are you sulking like that?
How could the lad not have sulked? But, stubborn as a mule before the bridge - he held his own: either she let him take his goat to wife, or - otherwise - he'd kill himself.
The emperor, poor thing - he had only himself and his daughter and his son. He sits and says to himself, "It's hard enough, and even harder! Water ahead, storm behind. What was he to do? He got out of the madman's way and let his son decide what he wanted!
The wedding - what can I lie to you - didn't happen. Wedding and merriment the emperor needed? They took the bride, one evening, with only a priest, and married her like a poor wretch! As if it were a funeral, not a wedding.
So? The emperor's son knew well that there is no girl more beautiful than his, if you search for her to the ends of the earth, as far as the sun... In the evening, she'd take off her goatskin and - take your eyes, your gaze would be filled with the light of her beauty, that's what she looked like.
Once, another emperor called them to his wedding. They all went, but they didn't take the goat - how could they? But she, when her own had gone, took off her goatskin, and lighted a thread of her fur, and said only:
"I'll be at the wedding in no time!" -
and he was there, like he wanted!
Everyone was amazed at such a proud girl. Everyone wondered who and where she was from! Something like that - you don't forget, even if you've only seen her once in your life! That's what she was like.
In the end, his mother-in-law couldn't stand it any longer - she was even crying - and said to her son:
- Oh, Mother dear! If you hadn't taken this goat of yours, you'd be in for a treat!
- Don't talk, my beloved mother, because the beautiful one you see is my wife, the boy whispered in her ear.
- Well, how so, Mother - isn't that the goat from home?
- Yes she is, but when she sheds that damn goatskin - that's what she looks like, the way you see her. But, pray, shut up, if we're dear to you!
Mother, still a mother: wanting to do them good, to see them happy, she sneaks out of the wedding and - runs - home. Searching, rummaging, and finding skin. She takes it and throws it in a hot oven nine times, and - ashes she does!
The goat, at the head of the hore, smelled the smell of ashes; on the spot it groped a hair - and flew away, screaming:
- Alas, my skin - my skin!
He was home in no time, but what good is that! The skin was now ashes. She cried, she cried, and - pawing once more at the goat's hair, she dislodged herself into a cloud - and the cloud carried her among the stars all the way. Since then she has remained there, close to God, and lights our evenings on earth. It is different from the other stars, being bigger than them. She is the evening star!
Her young husband, who ran after her and saw her crying and screaming her heart out, tried to comfort her, but in vain. When the girl sprang up to the clouds, he clung to her lap to stop her, and - with her - he too reached heaven. But up there, high above, he slipped, I don't know how, and falling into the pit, he too became a lighthouse - the morning star.
Since then, the two of them, only in the mornings they barely see each other.
THE SHEPHERD TURNED KITE
The story goes that two shepherd-herds once lived in our mountains, herding their sheep together. This was somewhere on the shores of a lake between the Zmolcu, Vasilița and Gramoste hills, between the Aromanian settlements of Avdela, Samarina and the great Grammostan fair near the mountain whose name it bore. It could have been somewhere else, for example on the shore of another lake, let's say - between the Peristera obcine, towards Bitolia. However, it is well known that these two shepherds - led it royally, where they roamed. All day long, rara-rara, with their sheep, all over the mountain plains like in a fairy tale, they were the envy of the whole world.
And so, in a row, when they were just resting in the shade of a huge beech tree, what do you think they were given to see before their eyes? Two beautiful young fairies! They were playing - needing big, beating snow. One was shovelling suet into snowballs, and then throwing it at the other, who opened his mouth and - neither one nor the other - swallowed it! The other one poured salt into his snowballs and threw it to his friend, who in turn swallowed it.
They fought like this, from dawn to dusk, when suddenly the kite, which had swallowed the salt lumps in the middle, couldn't take it anymore and slapped. The other, the one who had swallowed the lumps of tallow, had nothing.
The shepherds, what to do, also looked and waited fearfully, to see what would happen.
The remaining living zme approached the dead one, tore out its heart and livers, pulled them into the skewer and began to roast them over the fire. Then he called to him one of the two shepherds who were watching him, and said:
- I'm going to miss a little, because I have a little errand in the valley; don't you move from here and guard my skewer, lest some beast come and swallow it. And beware lest sin drive thee to eat meat, for thou shalt give the priest's food at once.
And he went on and on.
Our shepherd, a true lion cub, kept what the goodness of the skewer kept, but by twisting and turning it over the fire, its spice finally brought it down, he said to himself, for his sake: "What will it be if I eat a crumb? I'm not going to die of that." And he popped a piece of heart and a piece of liver into his mouth, and swallowed them quickly, unchewed. Then what do you know? It was as if he had put a jar in his chest; his blood was now running in his veins, and boiling, as if it were boiling over a hot fire; and his arms were so twisted, that he was tearing the vines of the forest as if they were green leeks; in short - the man felt so vigorous in his body, that he seemed to be more, much more than an ordinary man. He realized then that this wonder, this strange change, came from the skewer he had been eating. And he swallowed what was left of it.
After he had cooked the kite's frying-pan, his strength increased so much that he had no more strength: the boulders and rocks had become poor little stones for our shepherd; huge pines - he bent them to the ground like a meerkat, and when he stepped - the earth shook and sank under his feet!...
Late in the evening, the kite came back and asked for a skewer. But the shepherd, with the strength of a man and a kite together this time - for he had only eaten the heart and livers of the slain man - seized him and made a feast of him. Then he set off for the sheepfold. There he found his sickle at the threshing-floor: just milking his sheep. He lifted him from his stool and sat down to milk them. But what do you see? He didn't even get a good grip on the udder before it got caught between his fingers. Seeing such a misfortune, he said to his herdsman:
- Let me, you bitch, I'll milk the sheep tonight.
And he sat down again, at the lathe.
A few days after this incident, the older boy called the other, younger boy, and said:
- Take it from me, my friend! I feel the day of our parting is near. Sometimes I think of throwing myself in the lake. So, what I was meant to do, I'll do: I'll dive right in! Hold this whistle, and when you miss me, call me, I'll come out of the lake. But don't you and your folks get a word out of me, you hear? You'll never see me again.
With these, he also threw himself into the lake, and the younger shepherd was left alone on the shore.
When he came back to the village, they all came to him to tell them about his son-in-law, where he is, what's wrong with him. But this one - they don't know anything. At one point, the mother of the herdsman at the bottom of the lake, she softened him with her tears. He took her with him to the mountain, to the lake. There, the shepherd began to say from his whistle. The water immediately became a little thicker, and - from the middle of the lake, the shepherdess, now transformed into a kite, sprang up. This one, as soon as he saw his mother, said to his younger friend:
- That's not the way we were talked about; you know, you won't see me anymore.
The Zmeul - that's what he was now, had a fiancée in the village, a girl among nine brothers. When the brothers heard that her beau had changed into a kite, or ghost, they quickly betrothed her to another.
And - come the day of the girl's wedding. Just as she, poor thing, was at the head of the wedding party, the kite-man crashed like lightning, riding on a cloud, from Zmolcu, where he was, or from Peristèra, who knows - he grabbed the girl in his claws and took her to his palace by the lake.
The girl's brothers, unable to bear such shame, climbed the mountain and began to dig a ditch, intending to drain the lake, fight the kite and take the girl away. But in vain - their endeavour! What they dug all day long, the kite filled in at night with one hand.
Today like this, tomorrow like this, until the kite fluttered once, and said to the girl:
- Ian-listen, girl-boy, - it'll be the death of your brothers if I go after them: one doesn't stay alive!
The girl, sweet-talking this one:
- Why kill them? Better, just plug them up with a rock, and off they go, then.
So did the kite. He pulled a rock from the side of the mountain and threw it here, where you can see it. And the girl's brothers, seeing that it was no joke to fight a dragon like that, went down to the village and were left in awe, for they had no choice.
The story goes that the shepherd who was transformed into a kite - and still is today - is still there in his lake.
A BEAUTIFUL STORY
A Brahmin, sitting outside the door of his house, is visited by an Indian, who was a trader - and therefore had a lot to do with the outside world.
- Good old man," he says to him, "I am very grieved because of the evil that often drowns the good that I can do. I used to be a peddler - not much; I started with little, but - working and persevering, I got rich. But with wealth comes care, and a still greater care comes to me for my conscience, which is bought neither with gold from Orixa nor from overseas. Brahma and Vishnu and all the gods bear me witness that I have good thoughts and will always be just and good. So tell me, my brother, how does it come about - that sometimes in the same hour I am good and bad by turns, and at other times in the same day I am twenty times good and as many times bad?
Yesterday morning, a man from my family came to me with an open heart. He was with his wife and children, who were all broken down; they came to ask me for help. Seeing them unhappy, I helped them; which filled me with joy and warmed my heart.
An hour or so after that, the news came to me from Mandras that an Englishman had cheated me out of a large quantity of goods. I cursed him, though my brother was present, and a little later I also struck a servant, through no great fault of his own.
Towards evening, I went with my family to the prairie, and as I sat under a willow tree, my boys began to play around me, and the moon looked at us with a happy face, which cheered me up. There I came upon a ruffled, wretched man, whom I took into my house and feasted as a guest. And as I was talking with him, that wicked Englishman of Mandras came and cheated me. Then I began, with great annoyance and excitement, to curse all Englishmen - and my poor guest was an Englishman himself - that was obvious, and still too well! I observed him endeavouring not to cry, no more than to dare to answer me. His tears wiped away all the good I had done him. But at night, when I went to bed, my conscience was rebuking me all the time, for the words that came out of my mouth. To redeem myself, this morning I honoured him well, and left satisfied at last.
Tell me now, my dear good man, am I a good man or a bad man? What kind of spirits are those that fight in my breast? What drives me today to do only good things, and tomorrow not to hear of them?
Brahman laughed heartily and replied:
- Come to me again tomorrow, come at dawn - so I can tell you, after I ask Brahma.
The Indian left, and didn't close his eyes all night. The next morning he came back and found the old man still outside the door of his house; there were more gullies around him - smoother and deeper, filled with clear water. But at the bottom of each gully you could make out a thin layer of sand, clay and more.
- See these vessels," he said to the one who had come, "the water in them is clear, as if the sun reflected its face in it. So also the Lord is reflected in the souls of men. But when there is a storm, or when I disturb the water with this little strip, the sand immediately rises up and disturbs it. A little while afterwards - the sand again settles to the bottom of the streams, and again we see the clarity of the beginning. So with our deeds. Beware, say not of any man either good or bad. That a righteous man is good, and one who is evil is evil. Every man carries in his heart an ugly trouble, which sits well there - until some storm stirs it up. If you happen to witness a great deed, rejoice, but do not imagine that the doer is always to be praised. Likewise, if you see any evil - grieve, but do not curse, for the doer suffers too, and perhaps afterwards does something good and special. Blessed is he who has learned to steer the ship over the rough sea! Learn this, too, for the rough sea is coming to us all at once.
The Indian looked up, saddened, and said:
- Teach me what to do, lest my soul ever enter into who knows what sinful beast.
- The work and its measure - says the Brahmin - give you health, and in a healthy body dwells a healthy soul, which bravely resists all evil. Another I can teach you no more, but good advice and in its place I will still give you. Man has in him the power to keep out of the way of many storms, a power that shakes off the carelessness of the soul and then lifts the sand from its bottom, awakening it. Thou hast as much as thou needest. Go to the country, for the ploughman is better than the ploughman. In the country, the days are always quiet, and the fresh air makes your mind serene, nothing from outside brings you harm, and no chance has so much power - that it can rob you of the peace and quiet of your soul, which enjoys everything there, like little children, being happy like them.
After these words, the Indian went on his way and did as the Brahmin taught him - and so he lived in sweet tranquillity, for the face of the Lord was reflected in his soul - as the great sun is reflected in clear water.
REBUKE OF THE MIND
A bricklayer, pushed by his wife, left his trade to become a blacksmith. In a few years, he became very rich - which made his wife very happy. For a while, things went well.
When this man was dying, the woman instructed him to write his will, in which she would make him a part, especially in relation to the others.
And behold, the sick man called the notary of the fair, to dictate the will, and - after a few words of introduction - asked that it be written thus:
- I will that my body be restored to the earth, whereof it is made, and my soul to the devil - that it is his!
Hearing this, the notary became completely mad and, in terror - he began to tremble and did not want to write anything, and the sick man - getting angry, said further:
- Not only my soul belongs to the devil, but also my wife's, my children's, and my priest's. Mine - because I unjustly took from others what was theirs and kept it for myself; my wife's - because she pushed me to these things; my children's - because, wanting to make them rich, I committed so many injustices for them; my priest's - because he, going beyond the commandments of his calling, always forgave me, never scolding me or teaching me the right way.
HOW YOU BEHAVE - THAT'S HOW YOU FIND
Three thieves seized a merchant, who had many knaves with him, and taking them, divided them among themselves. But as they had been hungry for a couple of days, they were now terribly hungry. And yet not one of them would go into the market to buy food. So they drew lots - who would go. Out went the youngest of the thieves, who also went.
Walking like that, what's he thinking?: "You fool, you're only getting a third of what I took from the dealer! Wouldn't it have been much better if you'd got the other two?"
With this thought, he seizes and poisons the demolition.
While this one was at the fair, the other two in the forest had agreed to get rid of their companion when he returned - and to share what was his.
When he arrived, with the poisoned food, the two rushed at him and, killing him, they set the table and sat down to eat in peace, but - as if on the stroke of half an hour, they too passed on to the next world.
THE BAD CHILD
A very wise lady had a son, and she was so afraid that her offspring would fall ill, that not only she, but all the household would never dare to go out of her sight. The child, too much left to his own devices, had become a little tyrant, rabid with malice that did not please him. The lady's husband, her relatives, her guests kept telling her that it was wrong the way she was bringing up her son, and that she would lose him that way. But in vain they talked!
One day, while she was in her bedroom, she heard her child crying outside. This one, the rabid one - was scratching his face because a servant wouldn't give him what he asked for.
- How rude you are, man," says the lady to the servant, "if you don't give him what the little boy asks for; just listen to him!
- I swear on my bread," he replied, "I can have his eyes out by tomorrow, he still won't get what he wants from me!
At these words, the lady is very angry and - entering the room where her husband was with some guests, she asks him to come after her and to drive out of their house such a shameless servant, who sets himself against his mistress. The husband, who did all the bidding of his wife as well as of her son, goes after her, shrugging his shoulders. The guests went to the window, to see what was the matter.
- How dare you, said the master to the servant, "How dare you resist your mistress? Why didn't you give the child what she asked for?
- My God, said the servant, look - give it to the lady, if you can. Half an hour ago she saw the moon in a cup, and asked me to give it to her.
Hearing this, the master of the house and the guests burst out laughing, and the lady - though still angry, laughed too; then she was ashamed, but she straightened up, and from a mad evil, as her son was - she made it so that you would love to see him! Many a mother should learn from this.
HE WHO KNOWS MUCH ESCAPES DEATH
Dionysius-Tyrant comes out of the square in a row. And as he passed by so many stalls he saw, among others, a philosopher sitting in his stall, and he asked him: - What do you sell? And the philosopher answered: - I sell advice. - How do you give it? - Six hundred forints apiece, said the philosopher.
After paying them, Dionysius asked his advice. And the philosopher told him: Quid quid agis, prudenter agas et respice finem! That is: Whatever you do, do it wisely and consider what it will get you!
Dionysius never forgot these words and used them all the time, because he had bought them at a high price.
It once happened that, because of his tyranny and injustice, there was talk of killing him - and they even hired a barber to do it, when they shaved his neck.
And when the barber came to shave him, Dionysius threw him the words he had bought, as was his custom. The barber was so frightened that, trembling like a shingle, he couldn't even hold the razor, which he dropped from his hands. The man thought that Dionysius had spoken to him on purpose, that he might know what he had been up to, and confessed everything.
This is how Dionysius found out that he had not paid too dearly for the advice he had bought, and which had saved his life.
OF THE PARENT'S CALIBER, REMAINS THE OX SON
The learned and renowned Aristip paid a miserly, poor-minded father a good deal, when the latter asked him how much he was asking - to teach his son - For this, said Aristip, looking at the boy who seemed a little heavy - five hundred thalers! The child's father answered: - Oho! I'll buy an ox for that much! Aristip said: "Go and buy him. You'll make two with him!
A NIGHT WITH THE OUTLAWS
From Avdela to Băiasa, it's a three-hour walk. A narrow, rocky and steep path between the two Aromanian settlements, like so many in the Pind mountains. But even so, even such a path has its charms and, above all, brings back memories - sometimes the kind that make you shudder.
The most beautiful thing you can see, or hear, walking this trail, is the hawkish whistling in the foliage, and the coolness of the pine woods, - that there is nothing around but woods - and what makes you feel tingling in your body is that you always expect to see springing from the juniper bushes, or from behind the trees - some band of thieves whistling and singing hawkish songs.
Nowhere have there been so many villains as in the Pind Mountains, and nowhere have there been so many robberies as here. Yesterday, for instance, the people told how some returning from abroad had been robbed, the day before yesterday - that some caravans had been robbed, some corpses had been discovered before; and not a week passes without the forest burying in it another mystery.
I know this road like the back of my hand, from Avdela to Băiasa, because I have walked it so many times - alone, with others, on horseback, on foot, day, night, as it happened.
It's September, 1901. The wind is blowing hard, the leaves are falling one by one, yellow, withered. On the bare mountain peaks, reddish, dewy clouds are falling, shining and looking like ancient domes. On the hills, flocks of grazing sheep, herded by shepherds, guarded by sheepdogs, the fearsome sheepdogs of the Pindus Mountains. You can hardly hear the birds singing here and there, or a whistle blowing. People have grown cold, autumn has taken hold of the forest.
- How wonderful the sun is setting!" said Mitru to Curti, looking into the distance, towards Mount Vasilita, as he flicked his cigarette.
- It couldn't be more wonderful!" said Nasta.
The evening was beautiful - as words cannot say. The sun was setting red, like a huge ball of steel fresh from the flames of the fire, which seemed to turn the mountain peaks and forests swaying in the wind into marigolds. Slowly, his orb descended beyond the sky, and the full white moon took its place, rising up.
Nasta began to say a haiducesque song, with feats of bravery that even cowards feel like lions. And while he was saying it so, with fire, a long, thin whistle woke us all, as if from a dream; we turned our eyes to the side from which it was heard.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Which one are you there, and where to?
- We are Armenians, like you! We're going to Avdela, from Baiasa!
- You wouldn't happen to be Curti?
- El! What about you? Aren't you Ceanaca?
- Tiii! Fire-fucking-you!" said our friend, who was approaching, speaking hoarsely. Well, now, at night? And who is this gentleman?
- One of us," said Nasta, smiling.
- Of ours? Forget the joke, I see him dressed as a German.
- So what," Nasta said; "he's still not afraid of you, is he?
- Va-zică, it's under our protection, one of us," said Ceanaca, coughing.
- Whatever," Nasta murmured, and told him my name.
I, tucked tightly into my coat, as if for bad weather, listened to their talk, rather fearfully, and smoked. I'd heard of Ceanaca before, and now I measured him from head to toe.
People talked a lot about him; they even put him in doins, like they did with those big and famous outlaws.
In the evening, under the moonlight, this outlaw's eyes looked amazing to me! The man was tall, tall, busty, spirited and, of course, bold, as befits a chieftain. His pehlivan skirt, his bushy beard and his bushy beard made him both handsome and pleasant.
- What's your business here? Curti asked, gesturing to him, at once unintelligible and clear, with a certain wiggle of his fingers.
- After some loot! - winked the outlaw. But don't be frightened... you are our friends!
- And this "stranger"?
- And! This time he got away; if he's your friend, he's my friend too! He's lucky! I hear he's an Aromanian teacher, and that Romania would give his weight in gold for him...
I started to smile.
- Weren't you waiting for me here in the woods? - I ask him.
- You too. Besides, if I had taken you for a ransom, Romania would not be impoverished if she ransomed you for three or four thousand pounds, or Napoleons.
- Romania? Don't you dare put a dime on me! You're lucky, old man, you left me alone. You'd have fed me for nothing!
- You'd better hope the buzzards pecked you for nothing! But it's a good thing it was otherwise. You understand? Here's why you should be friends with us! But you know our habits.
I made him think I knew them.
- Hey! What do you say? Are you staying with us tonight? Say, Curti, what about you, Nasta? Your folks aren't waiting for you, ready to go!
- Shall we stay, teacher? You won't be sorry... With these Ceanaca's men - you don't have to fear the Sultan!
- Are you staying? You decide! We'd hardly know each other better!
I, willy-nilly, got... And the outlaw was overjoyed.
Ceanaca stuck two fingers in his mouth, thievingly - and whistled loudly. Instantly, about fifteen braves sprang up from behind the beeches, as if they had sprung from the earth.
- Command, boss!
- Up in the Haiduc's Meadow tonight, boys! Tonight - that's where we sleep! Go a few of you ahead, gather up some wood and wood, light the fire and put the rams in the fire! You understand? That's it!
Four strong men - they're gone. Flying, no less! As if by the hour after them, we arrived there, through the ravines and the ravines.
The meadow was indeed beautiful, tucked away high up like a blackbird's nest.
The fire was flickering; the flames were fighting each other, high; the embers were blinding you, red as dill. Three rams were sizzling in the embers, spreading a scent - you were hungry as a wolf. The outlaws had wrapped their cloaks around the fire, made mostly of juniper, and now they were roasting by the fire, frying. Their skirts were as black as tans, and their silvers, at their waists and on their chests, gleamed - white and clean. They were young all of them, slender and all heart. The youngest of them, a lad of about eighteen, was so proud, such as you do not see at every turn.
These outlaws were poor and poor people - all men, one and the same, in face and deed.
Before we sat down to dinner, a brandy - the best kind - was served to everyone present. The villages - when asked by a chieftain - want they don't want, they have to send what is asked of them; all the more so when it was Ceanaca. All Pindul knew him; even the peasants, even those in the cradle, had heard of the "fearless and fearless lord of the Aromanian mountains".
- Rams are ready, boss! Shall we set the table?
- Put it on! It's a little late, but may our friends forgive us! We do what we can. The life of a rogue - or of vultures, it's all the same! As lonely as hermits... And they also do what they can, according to circumstances.
With that, the chief of the outlaws invites us to dinner. The roast steams on fern leaves, laid out in the absence of plates. The jaws began to wrestle - our mouths were wide open to our ears. We ate heartily, and red wine gurgled from the haiduce coffees - still in our thirsty throats hard!
By the light of the fire, which would not go out, the pines were whispering, the forest was flying... High above, the moon shone white against the clear sky. Like a silver icon. On the summit of Mount Vasilita it seemed as if the vaulting heights kissed the earth, while the stars trembled, high up, like diamond pebbles; they trembled, shaking their golden dust over valleys and hills. The night was bright, full of mysteries and beauties: one of those unforgettable nights, and one that brings back so many memories.
- Ceanaca, brother, tell us something about your life! - we find ourselves asking Nasta of the outlaw. For so many years you've been wandering through the forests and mountains, so you have something to tell!
Ceanaca watched the wonder of the stars in the sky, the hen with chickens...
- Of my life? Well, let me tell you, my friends, if you're still not sleepy.
And he began to say, fiercely digging the jar once with a flick of his tongue and throwing his mane over his lion shoulders with a whimper:
- What is written to you, my dear Armenians, on your forehead! I, who know not much, but have seen much, and have suffered much, like Solomon. Look:
To still be twenty years old. I was strong and strong-willed, and I didn't care about anybody. At the horde - I was the lead; only at church... I was kind of a tail. My friends loved me, but the girls loved me too. Oh, the girls! I was happy for a moment in my life! But all that was...
I mean, I was twenty: the age of spring. The cuckoo would wake me up singing, and I'd go to sleep - as the moon rose...
The prank that led me to become today's sullen and rugged outlaw was entirely insignificant. At a trial, I was thrown in chains for twenty-five years! To be imprisoned at twenty, when all the world is yours, when you liken the forest to a high, high church, and when your soul is as pure as a mountain flower, when the morning dew is dearer to you than diamonds, when sunrise and sunset fill your heart with their golden light, when butterflies flutter, when roses beckon you to kiss the earth with joy, when your sweetheart's smile seems more beautiful and sweeter than the dawn overflowing!...
I was tried on a false oath. Let me tell you why and how:
In my village, there lived a rich man - who had come to rob everyone. Whoever didn't pay back his debts on time had everything mortgaged to him, he bought his cattle, took his land, even locked him up, slaughtered him and left him miserable, starving. The damned rich man - he took away all joy of life from the people, tormenting them like that! He had made so much money, so much wealth, that he played with pebbles like children with pebbles.
I couldn't stand such a man. Quick as I am - and not caring about anyone - I was the only one who could ask him to pity people.
When my father died I was only five years old. My mother raised me, poor thing, she knows how. When I was getting older, so that I could live on my own -, here comes this fellow countryman of mine, Chițu, - that dog with no God. He couldn't stand me, and he was always telling me I was mean, grumpy, grumpy. But do you know why? Because I didn't want, like others, to graze his oxen and horses, or work his fields. He did what he did, he dug up one of my father's policies and took my cottage, then sold me at auction and what I had left - to cover the debt he had written off. What else - he left me naked as a baby turtle. And poisoned like hell! My poor mother swore that no one, and never, of our family, had ever been buried with anyone; she swore, hooting, that Chițu was lying, that the policy was not from my father. But what use? He was rich, I had no money; his word was hard, I - a lad who was most valued for my respect for others...
One day, I was driven by sin to go to his house and beg him to at least let me have the cottage, so that my mother would have somewhere to spend her old age. But what do you think? How much that boulder there cared - how much it hurt him, too, brothers! Neither my old lady's tears, nor his daughter's, stopped him. Hey - then I couldn't stand all that dogginess and threatened him with hard, hard words...
As it turned out, someone in the village must have found out about it and... found a way to do what he... I had promised to Chițu, knowing now that everything was going to fall on me; but not a week had passed when I learned that there, in the village, the rich man's house had burned to the ground, and, with it, Chițu had lost all his wealth, because all the pieces in the barns had also burned, like the policies - turned to ashes, like the melted money. With crooked testimonies, and because I had also threatened him, they tried me and gave me twenty-five years in prison. When they told me that, it was like lightning: I looked like a fool. What happened after that - I don't know. All I know is that I was locked up at night with irons in my hands and feet.
I finally came to my senses. My heart began to pound desperately, life - with all my youth - now seemed to me like some kind of frightening ghost, some kind of mournful, ominous grave. In the corner of the window it looked to me as if there lay the severed head of my mother, who had only me! I was sure that even the Mother of God had not suffered so much as my mother had suffered, who knew well, poor thing, she knew that I was not to blame and that they had thrown me there, in irons, for nothing - as only a great schnapan would have deserved! I sometimes felt like tearing myself with my claws, only the handcuffs prevented me from doing it! Yet, through some wonder, I heard exhortations, such encouragements as "Courage, Ceanaca! You're young, don't be afraid! The Lord is watching over you!"
A few days - so I went, still in ugly thoughts; I did not eat, I had no sleep: - dumb as a stone, sad as a cypress in a cemetery. I searched the staves of all the windows, there was no way I could get away from here. In such circumstances - only time can still be a good teacher; it heals many things, it eases even more, and at night, when the stars begin to twinkle, it creeps into your soul - you feel it - the longing for life and freedom, more than ever... Strong and fearless as I was, I then encouraged myself. And the moment of longed-for freedom was not long in coming...
I have to tell you that I was taking notice of everything going on around me. I felt stronger than ever before: and I dared to strike out and get out of there.
One day - which had brought me my freedom, and therefore my life - I saw that the guards were thinking of something; I was approaching a larger window, with rusty staves: I felt that I was going to get out that way. I was waiting for evening to come only. And - great was the mercy of the Lord and His angels for their servant Ceanaca! And... Are you listening?
It was Easter night. The prisoners were sound asleep; you could hear them snoring. My soul trembled - like a swallow's wing. I was dreaming with my eyes open; dreaming of freedom, dreaming of my mother, and the village, and the forest. The church bells were ringing: ringing and ringing so sweet, it filled your soul with the great mystery of God. The whole of the fair of the Trier! It seemed as if the heavens were opening, that angels were singing in the sky somewhere: the night was a beauty, a gift of heaven and of Christ. The bells were crying for joy, all was no more... The flowers, swayed by the gentle breeze - spread their intoxicating fragrances; the canopy was paved with twinkling stars... And the thought of flight gave me such strength, that I said to myself - die, or I shall be free - like the birds in flight... I put my hand on the door, shook it once - and the key jumped out! Not a guard around. No one expected what I was doing now, and especially not on this night, when love in Christ was softening even the whiners' hearts. I came to a window. I pulled on it, too - so hard that its jowls jumped like meerkats. Only the wall was so high, you got dizzy just looking down. And down below, everywhere, just limestone. But I wasn't scared. I pricked up my ears: not a sound, it was as if they'd all died down there...
Gently, I took off my knave's coat, cut it to ribbons with a pair of scissors I had long since got hold of, made a knotted rope, tied one end of it to the neighboring window's rail, and, lo and behold, I saw myself outside, downstairs! My heart was pounding with joy.
I was quickly pulled to one side, like a ghost in the night. But caraula felt me:
- Wait! - and on the spot a rifle blared, disturbing the night of church bells.
It wasn't yet well-lit when I reached my village. I saw my mother, sick with longing and sorrow, I took up my arms, and - behold me free as the eagles of the black forest-covered mountains, lord over the valleys and paths of the place, free as the wind and as the morning light!... I had a nun - and she died too, as if from time immemorial! God forgive her.
As for me, I don't mind... Why would I? Why should I be afraid? Of death - how? I would - I don't think about it. One time and another they bite the ravens out of me! Where will my body lie? Well, isn't our old Pind wide enough? Are not the shady forests of pines and beeches enough to take care of my body, to keep it from rotting before the crows and wolves come to tear it to shreds?
No! I'm not afraid of anything or anyone!
But with all this, my brothers, with all this... I, who have been living with vultures and bears for sixteen years now, I, who no longer know what a house eaves is, since then, I, who have never been to church and have never worshipped, I can't remember when, - you see, I suffer terribly, it hurts my soul when I see so many poor people crushed by sorrows, by bitterness... That's why everything I have - I give to the needy, I help them whenever I can, and my heart seems to be always singing a dirge for these poor people, for whom I would give my life; believe me, I am the kindest man in the world, even so - a bully, as you see me, but I turn into a beast - as if anyone wanted to hit me in any way... I am merciful, but proud too; I am kind, but unbridled too, when I see the rich do mischief and despoil the needy...
This is... But - now, good night and sleep well... You're getting sleepy. Look at the stars: they're beginning to fade...
And the outlaw was silent, sighing long, rummaging once more through the jar; then he took off his cap, took his hooded cloak, and lay down by the stump of an old pine, truncated for who knows when. His companions had been snoring for a long time, because - from their side - the chieftain's life had long since had no secrets: Ceanaca had told them.
Quickly, my friends fell asleep too. The forest was silent - like a deserted church. I was thinking of Ceanaca's life story. The fire was barely flickering now, and high above, on the clear canopy, the clean, silver stars twinkled. The light of the sun shimmered over a mountain ridge, clear as a big girl's blue eye, and the moon - the beautiful and mournful moon, melted with sleeplessness it seemed, was also going to sleep just behind the smooth hills of Mount Vasilita. She shone like a golden crown gliding on a silver tray. And there was peace all over the land! Everywhere - mysteries descended like a shroud!
It's been years! How time flies! Hey, life in the Armenian mountains of Pindar!... Memories shake their bright silver, sparkling, from their own wings. It all seems to have been just a dream, like the glow of a star that has been extinguished for who knows when!
HOW I BECAME AN OUTLAW...
When I was a child, our mountains were full of "rooks", as they called the outlaws. There was not a village that did not boast of its bravery, there was not a chieftain of a Haiduce - who was not an Armenian. The outlaws roamed around like rabbits: in winter they wandered through the oak groves in the Thessalian glens, and in summer they roamed through beech and pine forests.
Day and night, at home or at the goat herds, at school, even at church - all they talked about was the amazing exploits of Garèlea from Breazna, Leonida from Samarina, Cușu Despoi, Cole Ghiză and Jurcu, as well as so many other famous outlaws, dead today. That's why we, the little ones - we only dream of growing up a little more and then becoming outlaws...
With our imaginations ablaze, we would often divide into two camps, and beat each other - until blood was spilled! We fought with slingshots, bows, clubs, whatever we could... But especially with the kettles... Yes, yes... there wasn't a child who didn't wear a heavy, tufted halter around his waist; as soon as two groups of children met, we'd take out our halters and start - to kill each other, no less! Men had to separate us, women - otherwise the law would be slaughtered!
At Avdela, in my village - we used to fight the people from the lower slum with the people from the upper slum; the stones would flow freely then, the slingshots would spin, even the knives would often come out of their sheaths. The parents - what do you think? - looked at us admiringly and praised us when we won... Only our mothers called us all sorts of names: devils, devils - because we came with the sleeves of our shoes, of our coats - torn, ripped, with our shirts torn to shreds...
Many of us were waiting for nothing else - except the hour when we'd become outlaws... One day we were playing at playing at being a shrew in the churchyard of St. Mary's. I gave the others a chicken of the shroud - from which the hair started to fly: the gags began to work, the blood to gush... And I struck one so hard with my rider, a Ciongiu, a little more grown up than I, that you left him lying dead on the ground!
- Ciongiu! Ciongiu is dead!" the children screamed.
Two of my cousins, and other friends, whispered to me:
- Wash the stink off this!
I would have washed it... me, but where the hell would I have gone? I was only eight! And I get an idea:
- That's it! I tell them. You want to make us outlaws?
- We will!
We sneak home, we stuff a bread oven, a bag, a rusty and forgotten gun who knows where, and... - scram!
We had gathered seven people. We stopped somewhere, in a place called Bubonea's, entered the fern field and lay down. To the rest stop!
The heat here, among the ferns, was sweltering; some green glow-worm would spurt out, shaking the ferns, and we would jump to our feet, thinking we were now real outlaws, with the posse on our heels.
Two of us - Ceapechi and Aian - were standing guard on a hillock, only they had fallen asleep on the post - and had no idea about the rest of us from the rest stop.
I was the chief, though I was younger; I call the streets - I scold them, they don't let us know when they're coming... the little guards...
And look, the day has passed. It was dark. It had been dark since evening. Towards midnight it started pouring! It made us look like paparazzi. Some of us had cloaks; but we were still soaking wet now; but what about those without cloaks? The Ceapechi was freezing. We would have made fire, but we feared the powers... No, we didn't even have anything - amnar, frankincense, and flint...
If it thundered - we trembled; if it flashed - we worshipped, or crouched - like snails...
The next day, as dawn broke, we took heart. We set off upwards towards Arzel, where a spring flowed - cold as ice. There, seated on the edge of the shallows, we had our snack; we also had a drink of good water, then - let's see what to do...
There were sheep bells ringing; a flock was grazing there, it seems...
- Boys, I say to my braves, you elected me chief, didn't you?
- That's right!
- Then you must listen to me in everything!
- Too good! Three of you go to the herd and bring me from there a walnut to cut; choose it good, and fat otherwise - I'll shoot you!
My comrades laughed, because I didn't even have a kid...
They drew lots - and the three were chosen and left. They were a bit scared, but they didn't dare tell me they weren't going... Well, I shot them... with the rifles I was missing...
So they set off with bowed heads. You could see they were afraid.
The rest of us went out into the streets and looked at the scattered grazing herd. The shepherd, bareheaded, with his cloak over his shoulders, leaning on his stick, was also watching his sheep graze. It was Mitru of Cealera, a cousin of mine. Four deaf hounds were guarding the flock. A goat with a blistered muzzle and another with a reddish face - they were grazing scraped and still their throats were ringing: cing-cing-cling.
I sent a boy to the shepherd, to tell him to come to our place of watch, that the chieftain was calling him. We were thinking, with this tertium - that the others could steal the noaten unhindered while the shepherd was away. Only it didn't turn out the way we wanted.
Mitru Cealera, the shepherd, when my envoy told him to come to the watch, asked him which chieftain, what was his name... And when he found out it was me, his laughter filled him, then he laid his zebra on the ground and stretched himself.
The boy did not give up: let's go to the chief!
Eventually, Cealera picked up the bat, burned a few of them and - with the words, "go spinning" - chased him away. He came back crying.
The other boys, who had gone after the noaten, also sat miserably away from the herd, for fear of the dogs. I looked at them from our watch, and my hands were broken with fear...
Seeing how things were, I took a cousin with me and went down to the herd myself; we wandered among the ferns and caught a ram; I tied his legs, but he was heavy, how could we carry him? I called for two more boys and barely, barely managed.... I whistled - and my three other companions came. I scolded them, they acted like cowards, I threatened to beat them up, they started to snigger...
- Well, I forgive you now, but you'd better hold on, you yawners!
When to cut the berries, we had nothing. Another trouble! The rams, nothing!
Someone said:
- We don't have a knife, but we don't have salt either, to salt the meat so - it's useless to cut it, even if we had a knife!
We dislodged the ram, which came running and bleating back to the flock.
We realised that it was not easy: our pistols lacked gunpowder, we had no knives, no skirts, no guns, nothing!
We thought of asking for everything from the village, as the outlaws used to do, or to take a hostage, and - with the ransom money - to pay...
They all said that's what we should do, take a hostage.
And, we have sworn to make hostage the first one who passes this way, that's all - let him be a man of wealth, with rich herds.
Towards evening we approached the village, to sleep closer to the village, because we were tired of the mountain, where we were haunted by wild animals. Besides, our supplies had melted since we stopped at the cold water spring...
The night was descending, serene. We stopped at Gugulecă, near the edge of the village, as the place was called. We sent someone home for a loaf of bread. He came back late, but with two loaves of bread and a pie.
We looked from here, from Gugulecă, at the lights in people's houses, and we listened to the violins playing at Petajo's Alexe's inn, and we kept planning how to get that hostage we needed so much.
Bursting into the village was not really worth our while, because they could have taken us hostage there; it was better to stake out a passing celnic and tie him up.
As soon as it was light, we were in the ferns of the Ghionoaia meadow; when the sun was well up among the pines, my father appeared, on horseback, on the road towards Perivole; he was coming from Ianina, where he had been for a week.
- Let's surround him! said my boys.
That's what it was all about: catching the first one to arrive...
My father came singing. When he was near, we whistled, from the ferns, and - four men, with pistols raised, came out before him. They grabbed his horse by the bridle and asked my father to come to the chief's mess!
I had made myself as small as a cockroach - next to a fern, and out of fear - but also out of shame! I knew my father was not a man to be frightened of ten men, not seven little boys like us...
When they asked him to come to the chief, my father told himself that some real-life bandit captain had sent for him... It didn't even cross his mind that... it was me, the great chieftain, and that my companions were the braves of my guard...
He dismounts, leaves his horse in the care of one of the boys and comes to me, - the chief!...
I was getting all clumpy; it was like I was a weasel pulling her head out of a corner, afraid. I wanted to hide better, and I didn't know how; I would have run away, but I was ashamed of boys. I was asking them to be brave - and now, me, their elder... Ptiu!
I took heart, got up from the ground and - with a trembling voice, ordered the boys to tie him up....
My father didn't understand yet; he only asked - where is the chief, and he hissed at me, angry - to get the hell out of there - because he was afraid that the bandits would take me hostage! He didn't know that... I was the chief!
- Tie him up, I shouted, in a voice like a rifle.
Four "lads" took out their girdles, to tie him up. My father finally understood that we were the brave ones... He laughed...
- You bloody devils! See what I'll break your ears, I'll show you chiefs and outlaws!
My valiant men gave to twist his hands, and to bind him; one of them put his hand in his waist, to take his bag.
But my father, tall and strong as he was, wrapped all four of them with one arm, carried them to where he had left his horse, and tied them all together by the tail of the animal; then he turned to me, took me by the hand, dragged me and put me in one of the two loops of the wagons; he hung me from the sieve's eaves, and brought us all into the village...
They were limping, tied to the horse's tail, whining, moaning, sighing; nothing!
- Baby, let us go! Baby, untie us!
Aye, you've got it!
I, from the eye of the deserts, gritted my teeth, struggled to get out of there, but - in vain all my effort. I had thought that the haiducia was nothing, but now I could see that it was coming out of our noses!
When we got home, my father called the children's parents - my friends - and told them the whole story and let the little ones go; he tied me to a beam in the cowshed, burned me about ten times with a rod, left me hanging like that, like half an hour, then he took me by the ears and drove me to school like that... The little stingy man waited so long - he threw me into a cellar full of rats, from where he barely let me go to the chindie...
When I came home in the evening, I was cold. One month I've been sick with colds...
And so it was with my haiducia, which lasted two days.
The whole village laughed at our bravery, and - as long as that summer was - the school cellar was called nothing else but - "at the stop of the outlaw Nuși..."
VERVERA
The fire was burning - a blaze on Urlic, though it was past midnight. Whole junipers, and pine branches - they were turning to juniper and glowing, far away.
Cola Dauca digged the tar with a rod and then stuck two forks on either side of the fire to seal the roasting in them; they had cut a bullock, stolen from Exarhu's herd, and after skinning it nicely, they were now preparing to roast it; Nasta, Dauca's friend, also a famous shepherd in his youth, began to whistle a song, while he was greasing his mustache with the tallow from the hare, for he loved to have his hair stiff.
- Hey, my friend," said Daucă, "look, the hen is setting towards Vasilita, and the lighthouse is also fading; hurry up, we'll be late in the day! People will start coming back from the fair, from Grebena, and - when they see the smoke... they'll understand that we - again - are enjoying the celnic's flock. That's why, go on!
- Don't burn the skewers, because if you do - I'll take care of it, it'll come out - like a dill! And then, there's still daylight... Aren't you looking at the moon? It hasn't slipped over the top yet! And the shepherds are herding their sheep for the second time. Hear the noise from Sargani! Why shouldn't we have gone to the sheepfold by now?... Last year, in May, we swarmed thirty of them - and the dogs didn't even notice us; Panu was with us too... he was a bastard too - God forgive him!
Cola Daucă listened to him and smiled, but didn't say a word; the fire's glow made her face red, burning, and her eyes teared with heat; she twirled her spear with a squeak and listened to the sound of the bronze bells of the barren goats of Tiseni. A mountain rooster kept calling to him: cucuriguuu!, a mule was calling I don't know where, and a gun was ringing from Cireș.
Not half an hour passed - and the wind, still holding, began to whistle through the branches. The sky was clear, but clouds were gathering on one side.
When the skewers and the whole cow were ready to be taken out of the fire, there was suddenly heard from above the hearth - a roar of boulders rolling down the valley. Dauca and Nasta, old wolves, looked over, pinning their ears back.
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Who's there at the fire, man?
- Two Armenians: Daucă and Nasta!
- Daucă! Nasta?
- Yes, us.
- Hey, bravo! If that's you, I'm going down there.
- Which one are you?
- Me? Ververa the outlaw!
And - without much ceremony, Ververa took hold of the fire; he was a Tiște outlaw, a man of about thirty-five or forty, well bound, sharp and cunning. From his bushy, black beard, he looked like a fiery strongman. A lean, lanky man and a dead shot. He'd been a hound for a few years, but he mostly walked alone, because he didn't trust others.
The Turks took his people and locked them up, but Ververa didn't give up. He knew what was waiting for him, because he had done a lot of things since then: he had burned, killed - and many others! They followed him day and night, but who could find him? When they brought him bread from the villages, his guides - that is to say, his henchmen - were told to taste it first, lest someone poison him; he didn't drink wine, cold spring water was his drink. When he slept, he slept like a rabbit; as soon as a leaf rustled, or a wild thing passed, how smoothly - he sprang to his feet, ready to shoot! And how proudly he wore himself: with a silver chain, gold-blown, and tinsel garters, and a bunch of yellow on his breast, and clasps - of all kinds - of silver too, even on his tassels!
Ververa had known Daucă and Nasta for a long time, since he himself had been walking with the sheep; the story goes that he had once quarreled with them - at the spring on Urlic, one spring, when the Armenians were again taking their herds up into the mountains. After that they became good friends, and not only once they saved each other's lives.
In one turn, Ververa - pursued and even wounded by gendarmes - took shelter in Daucă's alley. Defending the soldiers, Dauca shoved the sheep into the pen, closed the latch again, and thus escaped Ververa - no matter how hard he searched the pen, for the trail of blood that was lost near the sheep pen. It never occurred to anyone that Ververa might have wandered among the sheep. Later, as night fell, he wiped out in the forest in the arpiere - the dogs didn't even sense him.
Ververa lived mostly somewhere, in a cave in Tiște - where even hell wouldn't find him! That's where he lived when the posse harassed him; his faithful companion was just a big, sheepish, broad dog - and strong as a lion. He slept in the mouth of the cave, and would let him know, with his bark, when he sensed danger.
That cave also had another exit, so Ververa would sneak through there, like a squirrel - and then get lost in the pine forest. Only she rarely went through such trouble. Who would have dared to even go near those ravines over there? Where at most the deer - if they passed.
Dauca, Nasta and Ververa cut ferns - a bunch of them, and on top of them they placed the skewers and the whole calf, also roasted, steaming; then they took their knives out of their belts and began to eat, after cutting off the calf's buttocks and skinning the animal's kidneys. There must have been an hour till dawn. The vault glowed from the east, and the stars now looked fainter and fainter, like silver splashes on its blue. The fire was dying down, the forest was beginning to awaken, a sweet breeze was rocking the tops of the pines, somewhere far away someone was blowing a whistle: perhaps at a cowshed belonging to the copses, where there was also the sound of hammers, slow and muffled.
For I thirstily drank wine from the cork, a wine of the finest quality, pure as tears, a ruby red, the like of which has never been seen before! From him the plosca passed to Nasta and Ververa.
The outlaw, as I said, did not usually drink wine, for fear of being disturbed; but this time he wanted his friends to be allowed - and he drank heavily. And the big, bloated platter, the good wine - they made themselves, the tustrei - cuckoo and another bird... Ververa especially, as one untrained in drink!
Sleep-deprived as they were, they lay down in the shade and fell asleep to the songs of partridges and cuckoos, until dawn began to sift its golden light over hills and forests.
Ververa slept with his rifle at his head: rabbit-like, but he slept out of his mind. The wine had curled him up, it was as if he was now in another realm, it had cut his head off - and he wouldn't have felt it! Turning round once, his serpent opened, and from it rolled out some fifty or sixty pounds. Dauca, waking up just then, saw the yellow and stared greedily. It was no joke: so many pounds meant a fortune, a treasure! And what else there was in the lock! In the serpent's pockets!
When he woke Nasta, he pointed to the yellow and whispered:
- What do you say, buddy? Shall we kill him? Or tie him up and take him to Grebena - and get the hundred pounds on his head! Come on, speak up! Come on, time's passing, it's getting light and people are starting to walk around, he's getting up and...
Nasta clenched his fist, ready to flatten the outlaw's head with it; then he twirled his whiskers idly, not letting Ververa out of his sight; his eyes burned like fire, stolen by the glitter of gold; there might still be hundreds of pounds in the lock of theft; men of condition were coming.... celnici - with flocks of sheep and goats, that's all - to take the outlaw's head and carry it to Grebena, where a hundred more galleys awaited them, on top of the hundreds in the seraglio...
Gold called them urgently: come on, don't scramble, there's no time; tie him up and take him to Grebena; only - they heard another voice rebuking them: don't do this terrible deed; Ververa is your friend; you ate, you drank, you slept together. A man - in sleep, is sinless, like an angel, whatever he has done - is pure as a saint....
The two friends, the shepherds Nasta and Daùcă, still in turmoil, who knows how they thought to themselves, but once they threw their knives, which they had put their hands on - and woke up Ververa!
- Hey, Ververa, Ververa! Rise up, for the sun is up, and the world is beginning to pass by... Come on, wake up, for death has been here, and looked at you - and done you nothing. Raise up a church, man, for thou hast met two such Arminians as we are, who hold to friendship, and do not break their vows, and do not forget the bread they have eaten together... as you see! Come on, get up.
Nasta and Daùcă shook Ververa until he stared at them, frightened; when the outlaw saw the lira on the ground and the open lock, he was astonished; he took off his middle lock, counted the coins and saw that not a single one was missing. Then he could no longer for the sake of the shepherds: a warm tear ran down his beard, trembling, round, shining like a bead. He understood, in that moment, that there were still good people in the world; that not everyone lived only for money, the haystack and the unmanly.
Ververa knew that Nasta and Daùcă stole everything that came their way, that they spared nothing; but this time they proved otherwise: men of heart and faith. Therefore, with tears in his eyes - the thief took off his lock again and gave the shepherds all the gold coins - about eight hundred, as many as he had, he kissed them one by one - from his fortune and said:
- You could have killed me in my sleep, but you - look, you didn't even take a pound out of my lock. Here, take the whole serpent, for you have given me life! Now I'll be better, I'll be more merciful, it's worth it... there's a God above... And - stay healthy! And I won't forget your behaviour even after death!
Ververa shook their hands again, then whistled, called his dog who was sleeping somewhere among the ferns, took his rifle by the belt and set off along the path towards Urlic, where the outlaws have been roaming and the wind never stops howling in autumn and spring.
As the dawn had broken, the sky was red now, like the ember; partridges sang, pine trees whistled in the wind, flocks whitened the hills, the sun raced through the trees, yellow, shining like a treasure.
Far away, towards Vodènisco, a herd of cows was milking at a cowshed, and some cowherds were out ploughing, with their women following them.
Ververa had arrived at his stakeout spot and was now singing, bad-hearted:
Four years in prison,
No moon, no sun;
No more songs
And shepherd horses,
Still in irons, still in irons,
Woe is my youth.
It was an old haiducesque song. Ververa's voice soared sweet, trembling, carried away by the breath of the wind, over valleys and over ravines.
Nasta and Daùcă listened to him, deep in thought, their eyes focused on the hearth. One of them said:
- I'd say, with these yellow ones - let's raise up Saint Mary's, the church burned by bandits. They?
- You took the word out of my mouth, my friend," said the other. There's nothing better; it's been years since the village had a church. With Ververa's gold - we'll make it more beautiful than it was.
The church of Avdela had been burned by the enemies in 1906; it was a beautiful place; the altarpiece was unheard of. Everybody was amazed by its woodwork. The walls were painted by the hand of a craftsman, with the faces of saints as if alive. The two fârtați, Daùcă and Nasta, were thinking how they could make it more proud, where they would bring the iconaries from, - when, from the side where Ververa was now standing, a sound rang out: bam-bum-bam-bum! In bursts!
What was going on?
A posse of arnsmen came upon the outlaw while he was roasting in the sun on the Urlic hilltop and took him in fire. But Ververa would not let up - and the battle raged, the bullets now whistling: bam-bam-bam-bam!
Two black eagles were circling around, perhaps sniffing for carrion, and some passer-by who happened to be there was bowing at the time and hurrying away in terror. Only Ververa would shoot and gurgle:
Four years in prison,
No moon, no sun...
While the sun was sifting gold dust over hills and over forests, there, on the peaks, in the Urlic mountains, a mountain of the Haiducesc and Armenian.
FROM TIMES OF OBLIVION
It was around 1769, late autumn.
For three days and four nights - it burned incessantly.
For three days and four nights - beautiful, rich, proud Voscopole burned all around. A sea of flames had reached the fair, the head of the Aromans, the first among the fairs, - Voscopole with its thirteen thousand buildings, with its countless fortunes, with its palaces and its unrivalled gardens - for seven days!
The pear-blades, the thick clouds of smoke - crossed with those rising from the famous Niculiță, as from the mighty Gràmoste, and together they urged heavenward - to complain to the Lord, who turned his back on the Aromanians and let them perish, it is seen.
For years and years, bad people had been putting evil thoughts into Voscopolis. For a long time - her riches, her beauties were coveted and coveted again! Envy, jealousy - they gave no peace to the friends of the fair, who had no more rest.
Only the brave men of this peaceful settlement, its strongmen - they were also keeping watch. And - with their strength, not once did they resist the enemies who came to trample and plunder them. That's why this fair has become part of the songs, and why people still call them:
Voscopolea you can't prey on,
That many and proud are his braves...
This time, however, the unfriendlies swarmed her from all sides, like flies and ants. The field was darkened by their multitude, and the mountains trembled at the howling of these hordes. Thousands and thousands, they came, wave after wave. They came from Dagli and from Cologne - from the bottom of Albania, and from the sea; the turtle rose up, like leaf and grass, to spoil and to plunder Voscopolea.
They fought, young and old, and shed their blood, and the women - as the songs say - carried bullets in their aprons to the fighters, and they too, along with the men, faced the enemies so numerous that ten sprang up instead of one killed!
And they made the voscopolèni back down! From above, and from below, from the mountains and from the plains, the whole army came. Fire and flames were everywhere. The famous Academy was burning, and the printing press - like no other in Turkey, and the rich Library, and the schools, and the palaces - everything turned to ashes and ashes. And the howling, the shooting, and the screams of the women and the cries of the children - it made you think it was the end of the world.
In a house like a real palace, next to the gilded icon of Our Lady, a candle flickered. Next to the icon, standing, yellow as wax, Sultana. The young wife of Chendra Sarica, a man known and honoured in Voscopole for his bravery, had wept and was still weeping.
The woman, with her arms folded across her chest - praying, with her eyes focused on the beautiful icon, worshipped the Virgin - to save the man who remained outside the settlement, who with only two companions was holding up a whole mob of Armenians. For three days he had not been home, had not rested his head on a pillow, had not seen his children - a little boy and a little girl, two angels who clung to their mother's lap and trembled like two violins.
The day was gone, the sun went down, and he seemed to go faster - tired of all the evil he saw. The moon shone from the vault, the stars were hidden somewhere, but the veil spread the darkness over the fair, and - your gaze penetrated far around. The red, fearful veil - lighting up!
Through the neighbours, unfurled women, men with babies in their arms - they ran scared, terrified. They were running mad. Where to? They didn't know either! They were running in a frenzy, to escape the flames, death! That's all!
Only Sultana froze in prayer, staring at the icon. She could not hear the screams, see the veils of fire or the clouds of smoke. Her thoughts, her soul, her whole life - they were far away, outside Voscopolis, with Chendra, her dear man.
- Virgin Mary, keep him for me, bring him to me alive!
That's all he managed to say.
And Mitru, the five-year-old boy, and Sorina - the older girl, who must have been ten years old too - were not letting go of their mother.
It was well into the night, the candle had dimmed considerably, and the flames of the fire now surrounded the house, threatening to engulf it. But Sultana did not flinch before the icon.
- Mom, when is dad coming?" asked little Mitru.
At that very moment, voices sounded at the gate; then screams, cries, and banging - they came flooding into the house. Someone, some sort of madman, thundered through the door, and Sultana found herself with him at the top of the marble staircase. The woman collapsed, fainting. She had seen her man, Chendra, shot and mortally wounded. Two comrades held him behind his shoulders, while blood spurted from his chest.
- My enemies have eaten my head, my wife...
The man kissed his wife, embraced his children, and gave up the ghost. A brave man who seemed to have no death!
Almost at once - other voices burst out, other howls, this time more thunderous, wild. It was the harangues - many of whom Chendra Sarica had sent to the other side. Now they were no longer afraid, for they had no one to fear. Chendra is gone - gone is the power of Voscopolis, gone are the defenders of the city! There was no one to stop the raiders, no one to stand before them. And - they took revenge for the men who had lost them in battle.
They were blindly burning everything that came before them, they set fire to it - so that there would be no stone upon stone left in all Voscopolea!
Here they come, they're getting closer, they've arrived - and they're also charging towards the house of Chendra, the slain brave lying like a tree in the middle of the hall. Sultana sees them. There are many of them, and they are wicked - like venomous snakes of wickedness!
- In their hands I do not give myself alive!" she hissed. My dear, beloved children, - you have lost your father, and you will remain without me! That I must follow him. You - may God keep you in His care.
And - he snatched two sunny yellow ones from his neck:
- Take one each, and have a souvenir from me, so you know you had parents once...
And as the archers broke down the gates and doors to enter the house, Sultana pierced her chest with the knife torn from her husband's belt, and fell dead beside him.
The brats were in the house now, in the blood-splattered hallway, where the bodies of the two murdered parents lay, and the two little ones were screaming in horror...
The raiders lifted up their swords, to make feast and children; only their looks were so pure, and their mourning so heart-rending, and they so beautiful, that even the stony hearts of the enemies were softened, and their arms lowered, disarmed.
They didn't kill the children, but they took them hostage.
Many years have passed since then. Voscopole has never risen from the ruins. Its wealth has perished, its beauty has faded. Where palaces once stood, today desolation has taken hold. The city has died - never to rise again. Perhaps it was meant to be; only piles of rubble, a tree bent here and there - still bear witness to the fact that this place was once rich and full of life.
Away from here, a few days' journey up the Vardar River, there is a market town, Veles, where many of the Voscopolitans took shelter after their misfortune. There they healed their wounds, mourned their dead and their departed greatness, and then founded new households. And in a little while they were back on their feet, settling down thoroughly.
And so - on an autumn evening, also in autumn - as in 1769, when Voscopolea was lost forever - two travellers entered Veles. It was getting dark, it was raining cold and heavy, it was bone-deep, and the darkness had descended on the field.
The travelers, barely walking, silent, sullen.
- Where does George of Munda live?" they asked a woman who had come out of the way.
- Well, in the house on the right, she pointed.
The men opened the gate, dismounted and entered the garden; Georgi welcomed them with an open heart and a smile on his lips - although he did not know who they were, where they came from and why they came to him.
At the hearth, by the fire that was spreading glowing and reddening the walls with its veins, - George learned that one of the two travelers, the older and more shaken, a man in his forties, with large eyes, with arched eyebrows, was named Mithras, and was an Armenian, a merchant in Anatolia. He had worked with him, in trade, without ever having seen him.
- But how did you come to be there, in Anatolia?" asked Georgy's, a woman now withered, but who must have been very proud in her youth, when she would have cut out the hearts of many a lad.
- Few have suffered as I have," Mitru began to say, feeling a sort of lump in his throat as his eyes grew watery and teary. I myself wonder how I'm still alive, how I'm still alive today!
I - dear friends, I remember as in a dream, but I remember nevertheless, since Voscopolea burned. That's where my parents died. I was taken away with them, then, some arns. I spent about three years in the villages around Cologne, where I grazed cows. They used to feed me with cornmeal - me, who at home even gave the cows wheat! My master then sold me to a kite, who took me to Muzachia. When I was fifteen years old - I was grazing a whole herd of mares there.
How much we suffered in Muzachia - what to speak of!
On one occasion, I don't know on what occasion, the beiul went to Istanbul, and took me with him. There he gave me to a friend of his, who took me with him to Anatolia. And it so happened that my new master was a man with a soul. He took care of me, gave me a job, and when I was twenty years old - he gave me good money, so that I took something.
God willing and with justice on my side - I did not perish. Today a little, tomorrow more from the One above, I have caught more balm. And now, look - I can say I have something to eat and I'll leave something for the children - so they won't remember me on the road - when I'm gone, and curse me!
Mitru told the story, the story - how many things had happened to him in his life, and his words penetrated the heart of Gheorghi's housewife - just like a fire-reddened spike. She did not take her eyes from him - except to wipe away her tears, for she could not stop them. She was also a Voscopoleànca, and her parents had also died there... She remembered well how they had brought her father in, broken at night, and how her mother had stabbed herself with a knife... And afterwards - what trouble, what torments she endured... Just like this friend who now crossed their threshold.
As if by a miracle she escaped death too!
- And don't you remember your parents' names?" she asked.
- No, I don't remember, I was a little kid, five years old, I forgot. All I know is that I had a sister, but - what happened to her, where she is, if she's still alive, I never heard until today... And how could I have heard? She on one side, me on the other...
- Okay, but - you didn't get anything from them, any marks, anything?...
- Yes, I do - I have a yellow one, I keep it here, attached to my watch chain.
At these words, the woman jumped as if bitten by a snake. She wanted to take the yellow out of her hand, but her hand was trembling, while her face became waxen first - yellow, then like white paper.
- Dear Mitrule, my brother!
That's all she could say, she fell over - fainted, as if struck by lightning.
The woman understood that their unknown guest, who had told her troubles, was Mitru, the son of Chendra Sarica and Sultana, she being Sorina, his sister.
Yes, their parents had died before their eyes, and they had been abducted by the Archangels and taken away - brother somewhere, sister somewhere else, only to find themselves now - forty years later!
Poor Armenians - many have suffered!
MAYOR OF ARMIRO
Those who have been around Armiro, in Thesalia, tell that at one edge of the so-called fair there is an old buoy, from who knows when! And the minaret of the jamah rises so high that from it one can see the plain of Thessaly as if in the palm of one hand - and the mountains of Agrafa and Attica on the other.
A few months before the war of 1897, a legal tussle over this minaret had started - in the council that ran the fair. Some said it should be torn down, others thought it better to spare it, because - remember? - it might come in handy when the need arose. The mayor - the head of the town - was with the latter.
For weeks and months in a row, they have been arguing to make a decision, but they have not succeeded, because, with the herdsmen - from words to deeds is a long way, as from the ground to the sky. That's it: he who talks a lot - does little, or does nothing at all.
They would have argued and chatted for who knows how much longer, the big guys from Armiro, but come the war of '97, and they're sick of arguing.
Before they had even fired a shot and smelled the gunpowder, the gunmen imagined that if only they wanted to and had good legs - that they would get to Istanbul quickly and quickly. Not to say that many of them did get there - only that they ended up tied up and more or less unwillingly; and their legs - it turned out that they were very strong, but to get back on their feet, because the Turks were there before them, and even if they weren't - the Hermit still didn't know the way, so - God forbid - they could have wandered through the woods swarming with wild animals, and woe betide them!
That's why, like men in their place, they saw that the Turks were not joking at all, but shooting at the flesh, and they said to themselves: "Well, if that's the case - let's change the sheet!" And to make it easier for them, and to prevent them from stumbling in their flight, the Armiro pikemen relieved themselves of their burdens, which were in their way - rifles, swords, and other such useless implements, and then - run, say the lads, and - catch them if they give you a hand....
The Turks were minding their own business! Today they were in Târnova, tomorrow Làrisa, the next day Tricol, then Fersàla, Veleștin, Domoco... which the Armorers said they'd have to hold their own - big time! The pagans conquered them - like the Jews conquered Jericho, singing and whistling like a good will.
When this news reached Armiro, the Armiro people felt like they had a lump of ice in their chests instead of their hearts, and - all the time, day and night, they were shaking with cold, poor people. They had now forgotten their quarrels, their counsel had dispersed, and they all had the same thought this time: to flee wherever they could see, - to Athens, to the Peloponnese, to the sea, and even across the sea if necessary, only not to hear the shells, for their ears were ringing!
What if the Turks wanted this fair, and the households here? Good luck to them! They'd have given them each a gift, if only without bloodshed! But what was the fear of the Arminians? They said to themselves: what if the Turks come sneaking in without anyone noticing them? What if they come upon them out of the blue - and take them away like a pot? How could they find out when the heathen were approaching, so that they could wash the well in the meantime and not get it in their hands?
They then remembered the minaret of the twin towers on the edge of the fair. And they realised that the mayor had thought well when he said not to ruin it, because it might be needed for something. Now, look, only the minaret could save them the trouble. And you say he's not worth it, Mayor, to kiss him on the forehead!
And here the brave men of Armiro had the courage to climb the minaret every day and observe the distances from there. And when he saw the Turks - let him give voice and then let them all swarm wherever they knew.
Better scout than the primaries - no one could find out. He, as the good father of the fair, was due now, wasn't he? - to save his great family from perdition. On top of that, he also happened to have good eyes and a voice... Lord God, to frighten you when he once howled!
Now, there you go - poor mayor! He hadn't even gotten up before dawn, and he'd climbed the minaret. He rolled his eyes, from up there, from dawn till dusk, - to discover the Turks coming out of nowhere. And a day of watch passed, two, three days passed - but the Turks, ioc!
It was summer. The sun - it was burning hot! The unfortunate mayor was swimming in sweat and had a bit of a headache from the heat, but he held on nonetheless. Only every now and then, too, you could hear him say, "Phew - won't those Turks come again to save me from my ordeal!"
And a few days went by, and a week or so later, na!: the mayor unravels, somewhere - like a cloud of dust. He squints as hard as he can, pinches his ears, and - almost frowns! After a few moments, he heard human voices, and even the crack of rifles, then - as the cloud of dust drew closer, he could even make out flames and red hats, riders on their horses, then the crack of rifles, louder and louder, what else - they were singing!
"Turks èrhonde!" ("The Turks are coming!") - the man shouted then, that mountains and valleys shook! That's all, and he quickly climbed down from the minaret - lest others rush in ahead of him.
"Turks èrhonde!" At this cry, thousands and thousands of people began to run like madmen, as if devils were coming upon them. As for the fairground pikemen - they had thrown away their rifles, their swords, then - the wives forgot their wives, the parents left their children in the lurch. Dressed, undressed, as they were able - they all ran, as if they had wings on their feet!
In an instant - not a single foot of Armiro was left! And the Turks were coming, relentlessly... Rifles were ringing, songs were singing...
There they are... approaching, and soon they enter Armiro! But - great wonder! Not the Turks, not the enemy - of whom the brave men of Armiro had been so afraid!
But what could they be? Well, let me tell you, just so you know. It was an Armenian-Farmer wedding. The bride and groom were coming for the bride here on a Sunday. According to their custom, the Farseers came on horseback, with red flags, and they were dislodging their rifles. So, the bridegrooms were so frightened of the fakir bridegrooms - and the armies of the Armirots, and all the Armirots, that they didn't know which way to turn...
It took a few days - before it was understood what and how it was, and then for everyone to return home, all those who had shown themselves undaunted to flee.
And again the primroses began to climb the minaret, where the summer sun of Thessaly was melting him. But, in order that he might not be mistaken, as before, and again take the Armenians for Turks, he brought this time a helper, for - whatever we say - four eyes see better than two.
This made it easier for the mayor, because he now had a human soul to exchange a word with - on a day as long as a year!
Only now he didn't have to work so hard. Because the Turks - the real Turks - thought, perhaps, not to burden the Armenians with the waiting. They rushed to Armiro and took the deal!
CURCUSURE
I thought it was today! How I remember! It's been years, no joke - but I still haven't forgotten my grandmother. Often, on winter nights, when the wind is whistling outside, I close my eyes and - lying in bed, tucked under the covers - my thoughts take me back to the life of my childhood, when she was still alive, may the dust be light... I'd say she's still shaking her head, scolding, angry, scolding her daughters-in-law...
Oh, my darling! One was in the village. The "Curcùsura" - that's what they called her.
How handsome she must have been in her youth - I don't know; for that's how I remember her, old, old indeed.
She was only a one-legged woman, with a big hump on her back, like a ball, and she wore a veil on her head for all her days; she wore a shawl in the winter, with a sash over her shawl, and she girded her middle with a belt so wide - as wide as the palm of her hand - that you would have thought the whole of her maia was tucked in there; and on this belt hung a kind of dusty, old, perhaps from the beginning of the world, her shoes - wide, heavy boots, as if they were dragging the good woman, and not she them, to walk.
It would make you laugh if you saw it for the first time.
His face was all wrinkles, teeth in his mouth - none!
God, it seems, gave birth to poor de Cuscùsura - to be the mockery of the world, an opportunity for the lazy to rinse their mouths, laughing at someone.
She lived so long, you'd swear she'd never go back. As if death was angry with her, and wouldn't take her away - much to everyone's amusement.
When some people asked her how old she was, she answered: "...then ask for that walnut tree in the garden, because my father planted it on the day I was born". And what a proud walnut tree it was! Tall and thick - as if it were a thousand years old, and yet - at the time of Cusco's death it had not even turned one hundred and twenty-five...
Until she passed away, Mum didn't know what it was like to let your legs go. With a toiegel in her hand, slowly and slowly, she was not once absent from the fair on Tuesday. She seemed convinced that without her, the fair wouldn't go on.
It was, in a row, of course - fair day... Maia was returning home, towards evening - when day and night were getting closer. We, her grandchildren, were happily waiting for her on the doorstep... We knew she'd never come back without all kinds of goodies! As soon as she entered the house, we all rushed to her - and we were not a few, about fourteen of us... One tugged her purse, another her hand, another her lap, another put his hand in her pocket, and - as happened at christenings - we all shouted: "Give me some, Mummy, some!"
Mother then sat down by the hearth, weary. The fire was burning, a fire like ours, Armenian - it burned for an hour!
We circled around her, and she - in her old voice, perhaps from her youth - called out, "Oh, you've given me away!" - but she immediately pulled out a little peanut string from her pocket. We kissed her hand, one by one, and one by one she handed us all the peanuts. As we were making a fuss and arguing about whether one or the other had got a bigger peanut, one of the daughters-in-law, who was present, said, "Oh, Mother, how you fit in with them, and you're arguing with these brats!"
That's all it took for the old woman - to go wild, and then to bite her for hours: that she's not ashamed of her cheek, that she sits with her hands in her lap and her paws in the ashes, that her daughters-in-law are waiting for her to give them in the mouth, that in her time the world was different, that then the daughters-in-law wouldn't have opened their mouths in front of their mother-in-law - holy cow! Look, she, for instance - for seven years she didn't speak to her husband in front of her in-laws, whereas today - these young women speak without shame - even when they're engaged!
Once or twice he didn't finish - until everyone was out of his sight, mad; what else - he was looking for a fight with the candle... she'd tie herself to a word - and, no more quarrel!
But now - she wasn't set on great deeds. Boscorodi ce boscorodi and then turned to her little daughter-in-law, saying - rough and not so rough:
- What's the matter with you? Get the red cake, the wool yarn, the kids want marzipan, remember it's March?! "Marzipan, make us marzipan, make us marzipan!" - we, the little ones, shouted - and on the spot, the mother twirled a long, matching strand of marzipan, counted us, so that she would know how many we were, and then she took out of a rusty box - little braids with a hole in the middle, little brothers, and hung them around our necks. Then he tied beads to our hands and feet - with various little numbers on each.
- Don't take them off," he said, "because it's a pity! I put the one on your neck - to keep the sun from blackening you, the one on your hand - to keep the snake from biting you, and the one on your foot - to keep you from stumbling at night on the road after your chores. In about nine days the swallows and the storks will come, and then I will take down your little beads, and we will hang them all in the branches of the walnut tree for the swallows to take, and you will sing like this:
Swallow, tell me good-bye -
So that I'll be fond of you;
Tell me - my parents to live,
Brother, sister - let it bloom;
Now fly, what are you waiting -
And bring me wheat, bring me corn!
Girls, you - in turn, you say: "little swallow, little swallow, let your wings be my hands" - so that your work will work and your hands will fly like the wings of swallows. Take a dry bugle from here, take! Tomorrow at dawn, swallow it on your empty heart, with a drop of water only, and He will give you health from above, and you, my dear ones, tomorrow you will pour it all out of the white cowries - so that you will be happy, happy and beautiful like white wool! And don't touch the needle tomorrow, or the devil will take you away... the snakes will bite our cattle, and we - we'll keep getting sick, and they'll keep at our hearts, and they'll sting us, and they'll tingle through our bodies all year long! No more debts tomorrow - that's all you'll do all year long!
Uncle Teju also speaks humbly from his bed, where he lies:
- Mother dear, leave these and - God keep you - tell us again, you and your grandchildren - why do swallows have tails like scissors, and why do they nest in houses, and wear a salver around their necks?
Such requests made the late mother very happy. So she stroked her big nose with both hands, - a sign that she was in a good mood, and told us this tale:
"There was once a man, who was getting a bit old - like me, he must have been fifty years old... (Although he was approaching one hundred and twenty-five, Curcùsura, in his wildest dreams, would not have given himself more than fifty years!) And this man had three daughters, all well sprung, but none married. Yeah. But the time came when the emperor called the girls' father to war. But how could he leave his girls alone? He went mad, no less - and all day long he walked sullenly, gloating.
One morning, the big girl went into her father's room and, seeing him in such a state of crying, said to him:
- What's wrong with you, Dad, you're so hot you won't tell me?
- How can you not move me, my girl! Behold, the emperor calls me to war, and I - with whom shall I leave you, my daughters?
- Uh... So that's it. And here I thought you were made to think - to draw up my dowry sooner and then marry me! But you... you're all for trifles!
The other morning, the middle daughter went to her father, and finding out the cause of his bitterness, she spoke the same foolish words as her older sister.
And then the youngest of the sisters came up and said:
- You little boy, why do you keep sighing and crying and getting so bitter? Tell me, maybe we can find a way, something, to stop you melting like that, seeing with your eyes!
- What can I tell you, Daddy dear... That... I'm afraid you won't take me in like your sisters did... But - let me tell you: look, the emperor wants to tear me away from you, from my house, and send me to war.
- And for that, father, you mourn?" said the girl. I'll go to war instead of you!
The old man kissed her on the forehead for joy, then prepared her, cut her hair, dressed her in a man's clothes and - riding on a horse that ran swallowing the clouds - the girl left home the next day.
When they parted, the girl's father pulled three hairs from his beard and threw them after the girl. And those hairs - on the spot - turned into three puppies, which went after the horse...
The girl arrived dressed as a boy at the Emperor's palace, where everyone was amazed at the beauty of this new host. Only the emperor's son, when he saw her, felt that she was a girl, went to his mother, the empress, and said to her:
- Mother, the log that's just arrived is a girl, not a boy!
- I wouldn't say so, son, but if you doubt it - go to the fair both of you, and if she shoots at rings, rings, salves and bracelets - it's a girl, and if she stops at rifles, revolvers, cuffs - it's a bully's cross.
But the puppies - not far from the girl - heard the commotion and ran to tell her. That's why, in the fair, when the king's son-in-law wanted to direct her to the jewels, she rebuked him like this:
- Well, what - are we women? Let's go to arms - that's for big men like us!
In the evening they returned home, and when the emperor's son told his mother that the new host had shot the rifle, the empress said:
- Didn't I tell you it was a boy? But if you still doubt it, lie down under the beech tree on the green grass. In the morning, when you wake from sleep, the grass will be red under you, and if it's a girl, the grass will wither and turn yellow.
The girl's puppies, of course, again eavesdropped, and again announced their mistress, and - while the two slept under the beech tree, they kept carrying water in their mouths and watered the grass under the girl. Therefore, in the morning, the place beneath her was softer and redder than that of the king's son, who, because of this, could no longer be afraid.
And they went to war, and fought with the enemy, the girl showed herself to be unstoppably brave in battle, and finally won.
When she left the army to go home, the girl was taken away to a river by the emperor's son. But when she saw herself on the other side of the water, she cried out to him: "Daughter, I am gone, and daughter, I return!"
The emperor's son followed the girl so lovingly, and - when she turned to face him once more, he swung the ring at her and touched her tooth. The tooth he touched turned silver, which the boy knew would happen! At home, he told his mother all about it.
Since then, the emperor's son has been thinking only of the girl-pasha, and to be able to find her, he became a beggar, put on some old clothes, shabby, tattered, he also took a sack with spindles and went through the villages.
That's how he ended up in the girl's village. He went into her garden and began to shout: "Take the good spindles, good spindles..." At this cry, the girl stuck her head out of the window to see... The boy saw her, and recognized her - by her teeth.
The girl bought spindles, but when she measured the millet - because only the millet was sold by that guy - I don't know how she did it, she spilled the millet on the floor. The boy started to gather it back up, grain by grain, to pass the time, to be late...
- Here's another millet - and leave that one for the chickens, someone said.
- No, that was my luck, let me get it... the boy resisted.
And just like that - he caught him at night in that village. Where's he going? Because the inn wasn't around. He begged the girl's father to let him sleep there too. And he let him. In fact, the master of the house was so kind as to put him to sleep in the parlor, in the corner by the hearth!
When he went to bed, the "spindleman" noticed that the girl had crawled into a crate, where she was locked in by the old man. Then he got up in the middle of the night, when everyone was fast asleep, and sprinkled dead man's dust over everyone in the house, lest they should wake up, and he took the box with the girl on his back and made himself invisible from there, as if from a shotgun!
As they approached the emperor's palace, the girl woke up and heard the roosters crowing. She didn't know where they were, and she cried, "Father, Father! It's as if the emperor's roosters were crowing, as if we were in his palace!"
- Right there and we are - right away," replied the emperor's son-in-law.
When the girl heard this voice, she understood where she was, and was angry that they had stolen her from her father. She swore that for three years she would never speak a word!
They had taken her out of the chest, dressed her in royal robes, and - seeing her now like this, the emperor's son was left as a fool, because of her beauty! Only - what use, if she was mute, how could he take a wife who did not speak?
Almost three years have passed since then. What didn't they do to her, let her talk, but the girl - nothing, mute and all!
If they saw that, they made her a servant - and they gave her all the hard work.
The emperor's son could not remain unmarried. In the end, they fell on his head to take another. What was he to do? He got engaged - and then the wedding started! But as dear as the stolen girl had been to him before, he had no eyes to see her now! To lose her, they sent her to a kite-maker for dough, because she had to knead for the wedding.
Poor thing went there, but how could she go to the kite, knowing that no one goes without food, of all the people who go to her? Therefore, on the way, she stopped for a moment and began to weep for pity's sake...
Her bear took pity, seeing her like that. He stepped forward, taking on the face of a woman, and asked her:
- Why are you crying, my girl?
- Well, how can I not cry, missy? They sent me to the kite-maker for dough!
- Don't be afraid," said the bear. Go, nothing will happen to you. Just remember that near the kite's house you'll come across an apple tree overgrown with brambles. Clean it of brambles and then take an apple to eat.
Further on you will see a donkey, which instead of straw - has bones in front, and a dog which - instead of bones, has straw in front. You - take the bones from the donkey and give them to the dog, and the straw in front of the dog - give it to the donkey to eat. And one more thing: at the gate of the kite's house there is a well abandoned by all, full of weeds, rubbish. You must clean it, clean it, drink from it - then go to the kite without any fear!
The girl did as her nurse had taught her, entered the kite and said:
- Hello, you little weirdo! Can I have some dough? Because the emperor wants to knead for his son-in-law's wedding!
- Come down, my girl, down - into the cellar, and take!
The girl went downstairs, took the dough, and did not go back to the kite-maker, to say goodbye, knowing what was waiting for her; from the cellar she went out into the courtyard and away!
The wicked fairy, who was sharpening her teeth to eat the girl, saw her through the window and ran away - and went after her. When the girl was by the well, the kite cried, "Get her, you fountain!" But the fountain answered her, "You, kite girl, you were throwing the rubbish into me and leaving me covered with weeds, the frog's silk - and this girl is cleaning me, washing me and drinking water from me! So, you catch her, if you will!"
He passed the girl and the dog. "Dog, grab her!" the kite called again. "How could I not...", replied this one, "because you were throwing me straw to eat, and the girl gave me bones!" And he went over to the donkey, the girl. "Catch her!" - cried the kite and the donkey. "How could I not..." - answered the donkey. "Because you gave me bones to eat and she gave me straw!" He went over to the apple tree: "Catch it, donkey!" said the kite. But the apple tree: "Sure! You left me covered in blisters, and this girl cleans me of them!"
Thus, the girl escaped from the kite, to the great surprise of those in the emperor's house, that she managed to come up with dough from that, remaining alive!
In order to make it safe, the emperor's son asked him - in winter time - to sweep all the way from him to the bride's house, and to put apple trees and other useful and beautiful trees - on both sides!
The girl started crying again. The bear girl appeared to her again and said:
- My girl, stay indoors tonight, for tonight there will be such a raging wind that it will frighten the world: the trees will be torn out of the ground, and tomorrow's wedding procession will be as clean as a mirror, and there will be beautiful trees on both sides.
Even the brats were amazed in the morning at what they saw! The road - from the bride to the groom - was a garden, a paradise!
The emperor's son became even more angry and said to him:
- You'll make me red all the way from my father-in-law's house with water in a thistle!
Poor girl! She's crying again, all upset! But the nurse helps her again:
- What's the matter, my little girl, still no let-up? You get your hands on the thistle - I'll call the sparrows here.
But the girl picked up and held the club in her hand, and the sparrows plugged her holes with chicken. And just like that, the girl was on her way!
The wedding was on. They brought the bride to the church. They handed out candles to everyone. The girl only - they stuck slivers of snow in her fingernails. And when this thread burned, her fingernails began to burn. People screamed! They took the bride's veil, and the bride screamed:
Deaf, deaf - woe is you,
That you don't know what's good anymore -
Take your eyes off the wreaths,
That your fingernails are burning!
That day, it had just been three years since the girl had been stolen from home. Her vow, however, was no longer strong, and - as everyone knew her to be mute, she cried out, startling the people present:
Deaf, you little slut,
Walking among men,
To sneak up on me
In addition to light -
Swallow in flight!
The bride, instantly changed into a bird - and flew away from the emperor's son-in-law. And at that very moment - the hitherto maiden was dressed in bridal garments, and the emperor's son married her!
The bird that the other bride changed into is called a swallow. When she sprang to the door, people rushed to her with scissors, and sheared her wedding dress, but the scissors tripped in the rags, and remained there in the shape of a tail. That's why swallows have tails like scissors. The bride's yellow salver also remained on the swallow's neck, if you look closely. And, out of pity that she could not, as a bride, last her own house, now - as a swallow - she nests in houses, under eaves."
When the mother finished telling the story of the swallow, the day roosters crowed.
Curcusura (what a name for her, who was so good!) - it was all joy that evening, so that no one slept - all night! "That's good, my children," she said, "so that you will be awake all year, and your heads will not be only asleep."
I didn't get another marzipan with my mother. Still that year she came to an obsequious end. Now, who knows - her bones will be in the ground. And how much she loved us, the deceased, and how we mourned her when she died - old as she was!
What a life we used to live! We were children, we had no troubles, and to our mother we were her hen babies.
It's been years and years! Today, the grandchildren of the Cusco's past are all of us, grown men, scattered everywhere, burdened with worries and aged before our time.
TIGANOS
We arrived at the two rest stops and the mules were not stopping.
Downloading.
What a meadow! It was a shame to step on it. The flowers - the size of a man's stature, obscuring your view, the tall grass - just right for mowing. The chervangii were floating with happiness, everyone - all smiles!
That's their life: walking around at night, baking in the heat in the middle of summer, getting roasted by the sun. For them - the horse is more than their family, their children - because it is on the horse that the Aromanians depend; from the horse they wait for the mouths of the house, like the sparrows' chicks; the horse carries their wealth on its back; it also carries them up the mountain in summer, then brings them down to winter. That's why, if their horse gets sick - they neither eat nor drink; the chervangi then suffers terribly - and feels as if he has a dead man in the house.
Poor Aromanians! And horses, and sheep - how you take care of them, how you poison your lives with these cattle!
It was - one night. The chill of spring nights in the mountains, you can feel it well and truly. My companions were turning the blankets on the horses' backs, mules rolling in the dust, or grazing the grass. I myself, huddled in my saddle, was blowing in my hands from the cold, still uncooked as I was, for I had only been out with the horses that spring.
Old Duca, the man who never lazes, not knowing what laziness is, gathered an apron of pine boughs, gathered an armful of brambles, then pulled a bunch of straw from I don't know what sleeve of his zebra - and made a fire. Then he drew some rotten, splintered pine trunks - and threw those into the fire too.
The fire burned, the flames were soaring high, burning from afar - that they were roasting our cheeks; only - our spines were freezing!
We were still freezing, as we heard the first thunder on the stony ground. A caravan was setting off.
And the chervangius sweetly sang a song of longing, aromatic. I pricked up my ears.
- Well? Ton's caravan? said Bușică; Do you recognize Gaela's bell? Long live him, he's a mule, he knows how to be a guide!
Old Duke was crying. Where had his thoughts taken him?
That's the human heart: a harp that begins to cry - as you touch its strings. Ton's Gala reminded him of his Gypsy of old; and the singing of the chervan's lullaby brought back memories of his youth. That's how old people are. As soon as they remember their youth, their grief comes over them.
Of course, even the dead must be mourned from time to time. From the height of the eighty and... years that had whitened and bowed his body, old Duca glanced back over the unfolding plain of his life, put aside his ugly, dark thoughts, filled his pipe with tobacco, and let go:
- Hey, nephew! Worthy is Gala, but like Gypsy... My Gypsy is gone, no more!... The strength, the skill of that horse - what a miracle that another one has it. Tall, sleek, golden hooves... What was missing? All the gifts - they were his. Round, shiny withers, stiff saddle, tail down to the ground, mane - brush, tiny head, as if worked by human hands.
When I wore it - lion it was, nothing else. Gala moves easily - a rider, not a joke; but Tiny had no mate!!! After I'd put as many burdens on his back and said - come on!, I didn't have to shout at him, like other chervangii. He didn't suffer to know a caravan ahead of him, all he could reach and leave behind. Poor mules - they'd run out of horseshoes, chasing after him.
It was enough to pass somewhere once, so that they wouldn't forget the road.
Once, in Montenegro, we were almost taken by the devil, a great misfortune almost befell us. In Prișten - as soon as we loaded up, a thick blackness fell, so that we never saw each other again - two hours were over. "After the Gypsy!" the boys shouted. "Only he could get us out anywhere else"...
And Tiganus, with his sense, got us out of it!
When I was returning from Thessalonica with the rebellion of Làrisa against the pagans years ago. I only had about two hundred pounds with me, for a whole caravan! I crossed the bridge over the Vardar, and - as I was coming ashore in the water - two more horses fearfully bolted into the water. And the Tiganus is also notching. In a few moments, two Seekers, two robbers - they rushed up, mounted, with swords raised, and immediately they threw themselves at me, like hawks, from somewhere above. My little tyger was well fed and strong. "Ha!" - I shouted at him once, and he sprang like a bullet! You said he was flying, he had wings!
I'll be damned if they catch me.
Another time I was working with some friends in Tuzla at the salt quarry. And, we get a telegram from Veria that my father is seriously ill and is dying. He was the head of the family, I couldn't not be there when he died, the house was falling apart. People had just climbed the mountain; it must have been in May. I climbed up the Tiganus, and - after a three-hour walk - I reached the big water, the Danube; the river was swollen, overflowing. No ship was passing beyond. What should I do? I had no time to lose. I'm going into the waves!
- You're going, you, the one from Avdela! Or are you tired of life? - shouted a Prodomer from the Prodom.
I only heard his voice; I didn't look back, I was in such a hurry. I crossed an arm. But I had two more!
The never-say-die Gypsy was now in dismay. I burned a few of them; he bit the shingle. He dipped his head in the water, up to his ears, and lifted it again, shook it, necked it, and.... he sinks. Bluim! and I'm gone. The waves took us. The horse - only his head was holding him out; as for me - I seemed to be walking on water. Then I saw what a hearty horse I had!
"Pfff. pfff" - that's the way the poor animal blows from time to time. It was cutting through the water like a boat. We were halfway to the water, when - from above, a stump as big as any day at sea was sliding towards us. The little tyke stopped, looked and, like a man dodging a boulder, waited for the stump to pass, and only then did he set off again towards the shore.
I've crossed over. I got off my horse, hugged his neck, brotherly, and kissed him, right on the forehead.
Horses like this can't be bought for money. Not only was he proud to walk as a guide, but he also knew how to find pastures to graze... With him, the mules never arrived. Well, what - graze on trampled grass, or who knows what pir, or ivy, like other horses? He could have starved his eyes out - and he wouldn't have humiliated himself. He climbed, like the goats, up the rocks, down like a hedgehog, through the valleys, through the ravines, to find barley, birch, tall grass.
- I've heard him praising Gypsy and others - said Bușică, napping with a cigarette in his mouth. How did you get such a horse?
- I got it all the way from Dùbnița, in Bulgaria, from Simu, an Aromanian from Molovitsa, an innkeeper. I was, at that time, a chervangiu - no joke. In the spring - as we unloaded the family in the mountains, we jumped on the horses and - wherever we saw with our eyes: in Iànina, in Ghiorgea, in Bitolia, in Pèrlep, in Bulgaria, in Serbia, Bosnia - the whole world was ours. What places we saw, what fairs we visited; and we had to deal with all kinds of people; that's why we learned all the languages...
But live! What a life I've had! We never lacked for bottles. In those days - we didn't know what a stopover was: in one place we had daylight, in another place we slept. And we never got tired of running, of the road. But since this wasteland of an iron road came into being, we Aromanians have run out of hands.
It's hard living now, nephew; the troubles have multiplied. The world has broken down, we don't even have the cattle we used to have!...
MAIA TINCA
One Sunday, I was passing by Mother Tinca's house. "It's been a month since I've seen her", I said to myself in thought; "let's go and see her, maybe I'll find her in a better mood".
I walked into the house and found her as I really didn't expect: well-disposed, talkative and happy - like a sixteen-year-old girl. She was holding an unfurled baby girl in her arms, which she had completely confused, knocking her over. To please me too, she began again to praise the baby, even singing to it:
Trumba, tumba, tumba-mba,
Whose little girl was it?
Who don't know about it?
To my mom and dad!
Then he paused for a moment, sipped from her eyes, kissed her, and - when she began to whimper - sang to her again:
You little girl,
Pretty, pretty -
Get me caught up in the game
And shoot the hora with fire...
Just fuck her again,
In trouble...
- I'll play as long as three play,
To marry a cholteer.
I understood the reason why Maia was so happy. She was right, that just a child meant God's blessing, good luck and light of home.
Wondering at her good condition, I asked her:
- How is it, my maie Tincă, that I found you last month so upset, as if the donkeys had eaten the flour out of your sack - and all your ships had drowned?
- How could it have been otherwise, my son, - blessed be God - how could it have been otherwise? Pregnancy and childbirth, dear as they are, are hard with trouble! I have only one daughter in the world, and when I thought she must fall a wench, my hair stood on end and my heart broke within me.
- God is great, maie Tincă, and He cares for all.
- That's right, my son - blessed be He - but take note, nothing is done without the proper ordinances.
- Speaking of customs, I'm going to ask you to tell me a lot - what are the customs at birth, Maie Tincă. You'll oblige me with that, and I'll put you in a book!
At these requests, my mother told me many stories, of which I remember what I would have liked most, and which I list below:
"When the pains start, the pregnant woman has to hide them, so that no one finds out she is going to give birth, otherwise she is in pain and cannot give birth. In order to break this addiction of anyone, the pregnant woman needs to take the hand of the sîntă-maria (a kind of grass with five threads), to pour the threads into the water and to drink from that water. After that, the woman kisses the four corners of the odor where she will give birth. The mother, the midwife, everyone in the house - they take water in their mouths and sprinkle it on the pregnant woman's face. They make sure, in advance, to find a chick's egg, her first egg, then they get a pacifier and a flaking stone. These three things the pregnant woman takes, and she puts them through her shirt and says: "As the hen lays the egg, so shall I give birth to the child" (three times); "as the sow goes through the war, so shall my child go through me" (three times); "as the lightning bolt falls quickly, so shall my child fall out of me".
As soon as the chick is born, the woman washes in a basin. Then the milkmaid passes over the basin and says: "I have stepped over the sea and I have not drowned". Then she passes over a burning fire in a manger, and says again, 'I have passed through the fire and have not been burned'.
Before passing over the basin, and over the fire, the midwife - with an axe in her hand, walks around the nurse and makes marks, like the signs of the cross. When she does this, the nurse asks her: "What are you doing there?" - "I'm cutting your utensils!" - "What are you cutting?" - "I'm cutting your utensils." These questions and answers are asked and given every time those cross signs are made, on the ground. ("Utensils" - it's called the headaches, the dizziness of the baby.)
After all this is done, she puts the baby to bed. They put the hatchet under her pillow to keep her from getting dizzy again. Around the bed, under the bedding - they unroll a rope, so that no misfortunes can pass through to the bed, and no mares can get to the baby. Both the axe and the rope are kept - from three to nine days, like this. The scissors with which the midwife cut the baby's navel are also tucked under the pillow. She keeps them closed, or else the baby and his mother will have a heartbeat. To keep her from drowning, a ring is hung around her neck, strung on a thread of red and white paint. This ring the woman wears like this - until she gets soft. A piece of this thread also hangs on the door of the nurse's room.
Three days after the birth, on the third evening, at midnight, the Yew and the Good Mother come to lead the little one. From dawn, a girl who has both her father and her mother alive, kneads dough to make three cakes. In the evening, when the juleps arrive, the parents put a bag of coins under the baby's head, or hang a bundle of coins around its neck, and put a book, a pen and ink, one of the three cakes and a cup of wine. There are three of them. Each of them gobbles from the nougat, drinks from the wine - and then leads what her heart desires, for the little one. Of all that is waged here, there remains and is fulfilled only what the least of the fairies says. (The bag of coins is placed to make the child rich, and the cake and wine - to please the fairies, the Iele, as well as the Bune.)
It is said that the Eels and the Good Ones sit in palaces with several mules. All they do is run around all day, romping through the countless rooms and palace cellars. So big are their palaces that they never sleep two nights in the same room. In the room where they sleep, there they dine. Dinner - sometimes it's as good as it gets, but other times - as bad as it gets. As they sit at the table, the fairies receive a list of all the babies born that day. They take the list, pass it from one to the other, then - only to hear them say: "As we are this evening, so may it be with those who have seen daylight today". So the little ones have in life the luck of the fairies from the day they are born, - as the fairies have good or less good food and dwellings.
When she has guests, the milkmaid should not spend them, because that way she spends her milk, which dries them up. When the baby cries too often, you can throw it away. This is how it's done: an old lady of the house goes out of the window at night with a little thing of the little one's, something, and when she sees light, she says: "Our baby cried for the girl" - or for the boy - "that one..." (you say a name, from the neighbours), "from here before the girl cried" or the boy "that one"... "for my little boy!"
If the little one gets sick of the moon, then you can throw him to the moon like this: the little one's mother carries him out to the moon at night. Then she throws him three times to the moon, like this: "Until now, Miss..." or Nicusor... "I was your mother. From now on - I'll be your butcher and the moon is your good mother". That's what he says, three times - and he misses the moon. (Moon-sickness or moon-sickness - is a disease that weakens the baby a lot; it brings him colds, gives him diarrhea and so on.)
When the milkmaid has a daughter - and she wants to stop having daughters, she can get rid of the girls. As soon as she leaves the house for the first time, after forty days, and comes across another cow who has a boy, she says so: "Your sons to me, my daughters to you!" And in this way he never gives birth to another girl.
She can also take milk from another milkmaid, saying: "Your milk - to me, my milk - to you!"
So that the milk might come again to the milkmaid, a midwife goes at dawn to water a bushel of bread at three wells facing the sun, and she says, the midwife: "As the water of the fountain cleanses, so shall the milk of the nurse flow; as the sun fills the fountain with light, so shall the milk fill the breast of the nurse." This bread, then, the milkmaid eats.
Bread - it is also given to a cowherd, to wet it at all the springs where the day passes, then the cowherd eats it. So that her milk does not dry up, it is required that for forty days she shall not see any light from any strange house..."
And many other things Mother Tinca told me, but I don't remember them all. When she finished telling these stories, the baby had fallen asleep and was just waking up. Maia took him in her arms and began to sing to him again:
- Dear girl, tell me straight--
What are you hiding in my chest?...
- Felegene-ascund, wine!
- Give them to me, and I bow
Only to you, sweet sigh...
And then:
The cocks that make you angry
And drain the bank of garbage -
Take your chicken and go,
Winter is coming - now!
I got up and gently caressed her little girl too, wishing Maia a long life and good luck to God.
A TELEGRAM
A cool breeze came in from the sea, and the raw leaves of the trees whispered a sad, heart-drying song. The cherry-trees swayed their proud crowns in the clear sky, laden with white blossoms, that sparkled in the sun like the snowy crest of Olympus, and murmured their joy for their too beautiful robes. The shaken blossoms swayed gently in the air and then lay like snowflakes - on the soft, green, wiry grass. An intoxicating scent of roses filled the whole garden, while the bees were flying from blossom to blossom, flying like bullets sent from far away, from who knows where.
Under a bushy walnut tree sat, upright, a young wife, about twenty-eight years old, toasting her pitchfork. She was tall and slender; her body was like a cypress, and her hair was thin, and she wore it braided in two arm-thick braids twisted on the top of her head. Her high, serene forehead was the whiteness of milk froth. Her eyebrows, knitted together, black and thin as two hennahs - bordered her blue eyes, as if painted, or worked in silk thread, bathed in a kind of sweetness you couldn't get enough of. He looked more like an angelic wonder than a human, an angel who only lacked wings.
Two children were playing next to her: a boy about eight years old and a girl about six: Neluț and Florica. The boy was dragging behind him a caravan of wooden horses, arranged according to state - the tallest at the front and the smallest at the back, all carrying bundles of fresh grass. The little girl, a peacock, not another, with wide eyes the colour of the open sky, was putting her dolls to sleep, so that they might sleep a little too, in the little pebble house, made by her little hands.
The woman twisted, the spindle spun sizzling, and the thread gathered in countless stitches. But like the spindle, thoughts were spinning, in her beautiful head, also dark thoughts. It's almost a month since her man, Tule, wrote her that he was coming home and - he didn't show up at all. The delay made her uneasy, troubled her mind, and tore at her unhappy, obdurate heart. For, you know, as she found out - from one, from another, the wilderness that America is so far away, you can't even think your way to it. And then, the perils of the journey across the endless sea...
When these thoughts had exhausted her completely, tears - seemingly senseless, began to trickle down her beautiful cheeks, and a sigh from the depths of her heart uncovered her thin, cherry lips.
The children looked at their mother in fright and, seeing her eyes watering, they forgot about playing and gathered around her.
- What's wrong, Mom? - the little boy asked her, his voice pained and... more than a little weepy.
- I'm all right, Mother dear!
- What - nothing? Then why are you crying if you have nothing?...
- Me? Cry? Yes, darling!
- Yes, you did! What, I don't see tears in your eyes? Look, you have tears on your cheeks too!
- Well... I cried! I cried for your sake, because you're playing nice and you're goody-goody!
At that moment, a bluish cuckoo sat on a twig of the walnut tree above their heads. The twig swayed two or three times, up and down, and the bird began to sing its name.
The children looked up, happy to see the cuckoo, and Nelut said again to his mother:
- Mom, when did the cuckoo arrive?
- The day before yesterday, Mommy's baby!
- What about the swallows?
- But the swallows!...
- Mother, where do the swallows go in winter?
- Away... away...
- Away... away... So, how far is it?
- A lot! You have no idea...
- Very much... Mom, is America even farther away than where the birds go in winter? Why doesn't Dad come, like the swallows come in the spring?
- Here he comes, darling. Didn't I tell you he was coming?
- Yeah, but when, Mom?
- Soon, soon.
- And he'll bring me a book bag?
- Of course it brings you, you hear - talk!
- And the ball?
- And!
- And me - a doll from the fair, with pear-shaped eyes, like Aunt Lena's Aura?
- And you, beautiful mother, and you!
- Mum, Neluț asked - isn't daddy a big man?
- It is, my eye, it's the size of that green tree on the plain!
- And is our daddy handsome, too?
- What if he's handsome? Oh, he's just as handsome as you are, you little gypsy mama! - and the poor woman hugged her baby and covered him with kisses.
But the gate was slammed, and the young wife jumped up as if bitten by a snake. On the path towards the gate she saw Tuli, a village clerk and cousin of hers, running through the rose bushes. He was still waving an envelope from a distance and shouting loudly:
- What are you giving me, Zora, - here's a telegram from the Tull!
The woman shudders. She didn't know why, but the news scared her more than it cheered her. But the fright was pointless, because the telegram was only from Țulea, from her darling, from her long-awaited stranger, who had written to her a month ago that he was coming back soon. She took two steps towards Tuli, her cousin, and said, smiling:
- Ah... I knew it, I knew it... that she was coming and this weather. She even wrote to me...
Neluț and Florica, too - hearing what it was about, wanted to make sure it was so:
- Who's coming, Mom?
- Daddy, - mother's lights... Daddy's coming!
- Dad? He's coming?... - and the little ones couldn't stand it any longer, they were jumping around the yard and shouting incessantly: "Daddy, Daddy's coming!... Daddy's coming"...
Zora took the telegram, opened it and began to read it in thought, but - without a word - collapsed, as if struck by lightning, at the root of the walnut tree.
Tuli, seeing Zora unconscious, and not understanding what had happened, ran into the house to call Zora's father.
The courtyard fills up quickly. Women screamed, slapping their palms in astonishment, while Zora's children, like two frightened pigeons, wandered among the people without understanding what was really going on. When they saw that everyone was crying and screaming, they were overcome with a kind of grief and fear, and - like everyone else - they burst into tears.
Tall, bareheaded and with shoulder-length white hair, the priest, leaning against the trunk of the walnut tree, said nothing. His grief had made him completely numb and dried up the wellspring of his tears. With lowered eyelashes, he held the telegram in his right hand and read it. He'd read it a hundred times perhaps, but he still couldn't believe his eyes. Should Țulea go to pieces? And yet, that's what it said in the telegram sent by Dima, the priest's son and Zora's brother. It couldn't be a lie, so Țulea died!
The next day - as if lightning had struck the whole village. So much grief and bitterness had come over the people, you'd have thought the whole village was a deserted grave in a wasteland. The wars no longer worked, the wool-spinning wheels - neither did they, nor the piping no longer creaked in their seats. Not a trace of people was to be seen, not even a dog barked. Only in the middle of the settlement, in the white house, which rose up in the priest's garden, drowned in flowers, there was a deep murmur, as if from a tomb, like a heart-scorching mournful song - like arrows reddened in the fire.
Around chindie, the church bell began to ring slowly and hoarsely, as if for the dead. Its roar pierced the frozen sky and carried the pain far, far away... through the rocky outcrops of the lonely mountain.
Zora's dead!... And the whole village, in great numbers, gathered at the white house in the middle of the garden, to see Zora, the priest's daughter, one last time, the flame that so many villages would have wanted in one of their own.
On either side of the dead man covered with flowers, Neluț and Florica, two grieving angels - as if guarding Christ's tomb. Your heart broke with grief, and you didn't know who to mourn more. Should you weep for the young wife - a flower that had been cut down at the beginning of her spring, or for the two orphans, left desolate and without support in the world?
When the priest threw the last handful of dust over his face, he raised his eyes to heaven and said, his voice choked with tears:
- This estrangement, far out in the world... cursed be it of estrangement... that it desolates our villages of sons! Alienation, alienation - you've always been the executioner of our shepherds here!
GARDANI
Tegă's turned home very angry. He barely got into the house, his wife took him in:
- Hey! He didn't show up today?
- No, said Tegă, no way.
- That's what happens when you give yourself to an unknown man, a stranger; I don't know how you found him, to haggle with a shepherd and hand over your fortune. And - God forbid - what if he goes, herd and all - all over the world?!
Tegă said nothing more. It was as if the hail was beating down on him, here, in this silent room, where the darkness of the night was now creeping in, and he thought it was like his wife says. It can't be like that: he takes her through the hills, herds her who knows where, and then - catches the orbu... gouges her eyes out!
This shepherd had dark eyes, shaded by high, thick eyebrows... The way she looked at him, he didn't look like a good man. Slowly, his Tegă remembered how he had come here, - a short, broad-headed man, with a sunburnt, hairy face, a man with a long face, a man with a long face, who was very talkative about what he needed:
- I came to you, my friend. I hear you've got yourself a herd of goats: haggle me to bring them to you.
The sheath measures him from head to toe. One like that, he really needed it - for the herd. And he asked him:
- Where are you from?
- Well, I'm... from around here, from Blata. Toli, if you've heard, Toli the cowboy. I've served a lot of cellies.
Al's Tegă measured it once more, on second thought - and decided:
- Well, I'll haggle with you - I've done a lot of haggling in my life, they've stolen from me and others have stolen from me; if I have to fuck you too, so be it, but He, God, will beat you for it!
Toli got into the bread - and she was acting like she couldn't be better! Who could complain about such a man?
A couple of weeks later - both Tegas and Toli went down to Thessaloniki. They bought goats from there, over a thousand heads. Then, on his return, Tegă - for fear of being preyed upon by the furies - set out early, by stealth, leaving the shepherd to bring the herd alone.
But since then it's been like nine days, ten... and Toli - nothing. One thing or another... - many things were going through Tegă's mind. At night, he couldn't rest. He would fall asleep for a moment and wake up immediately, still thinking of the shepherd - and so on, until the roosters crowed. In the morning he got up, heavy as he was, took a staff in his hand and started off, walking slowly, towards the hills, where the wide open sky opened up - as far as the palm of your hand, the whole plain.
The glorious sun had just risen. Big, round and red-red, it first lit up the mountain tops, then its fiery rays slid down into the deep valleys. And it lit up the windows of village houses, which dazzled you with its light playing on their faces. Sparrows of all kinds, too, were awakening from their nests, and on the plains - white and yellowish flowers, and snowdrops, and snowdrops, and maples, like golden hulls were bursting into the light, making their way from among the grasses.
Tega didn't take notice of such beauty. His gaze only pierced the field. And after a while, he breathed a sigh of relief. From far away, a cloud of dust rose, drifting this way. ...
The herd, he whispered. Then the bells were heard, clean and sweet, through the spring air, like a song; and haida-haida, at the head of the goat-herd, the herd was ever approaching, here were the two sheepdogs - tongues hanging out, with heat, often blowing, here was the shepherd at the last, with the zebra on his shoulders.
- Welcome," Tegă wished him from the heart. Hey Toli - you're late, boy! I was just going in for an opinion...
- You were late, I was late, I was late, I was late.
The goats were frolicking around, prancing - beautiful, all of them, darlings, with their silky hair, so that Tegă wanted to take the shepherd in his arms, to hold him to his chest and kiss him, uncontrollably!
His Tegă kept his flock - as he did every year - in the mountains around here, the Aitoși mountains. The bread, salt and whatever else was missing fell to Toli. Every two or three days, you would see him leave his herd in the care of another shepherd, and go down to his masters. Tegă's was working in the war. Toli would go into the house and give out weeds:
- Good weather!
- Good be your heart, Toli," the woman replied, sweetly. Tegă is not at home, but sit down, he's coming, sit down, man, sit down.
The shepherd shook his wedge and sat down without a word. This room, facing east, looked out over the open - so that you could see far, far away where the sky rested on the mountain ridges. Through the window the hills stood frozen in the noonday light, and through the hills a road wound, on which mules, laden with burdens, walked in chain-linked caravans until they were lost beyond in the valleys. A thin, cotton-white cloud barely moved in the heat of the sky.
Tegă's was weaving, and he was throwing the shepherd a word:
- Well, she asked, how are you, Toli? How are your goats? What do you say, shall we do business with them?
- We do, of course we do, he replied.
And that's it. Not another word from him. He sits, looking lost, heavy-lidded, frozen in it and dark in the face.
Guests came here from the neighbours: Lena, Tegă's wife's sister, and Sile's aunt, a very curious old woman, and a couple of others; they came to sit and weave stockings, or to twist the pitchfork in their waists, and they didn't leave until evening, and they talked, and what the country was up to... But they also had something to talk about: that month two butchered merchants had just been found near their village, on the high road. Who killed them? Well, who - if not Gardani! They were talking about him again. Gardani, the outlaw Gardani... He was no joke! Gardani had become a kind of shadow of everyone... He followed you everywhere, even if you didn't know what he looked like. Everywhere and all the time, he was the talk of the town, even the children knew his story, and if you asked someone older, you didn't have to pray too much to hear it:
- There lived in a village a beautiful girl - take her head, she was so beautiful, and she was about the same size as Gardani - an innocent little boy too, and they were very fond of each other, they walked together, they played together, they played, I mean - like two butterflies, not otherwise. You could find them both in the garden, in the courtyard, in the meadows - always side by side, either looking for a four-leaf clover or playing the berber on the field. Only, people changed too: the girl's breasts began to grow, and when she breathed - her dress would be puffed up on her chest; then, after a while, they stopped kissing, they would become more and more withdrawn when they were alone, and when they looked into each other's eyes - they were ashamed, she blushed all over, like a royal apple, while Gardani's lips trembled... And then, as if the devil pushed him - an enemy appeared, one Dinu, son of a celnic, with fortune. He stood between them, went and asked the girl to marry him - her father. And the father didn't ask her, didn't think about it - and gave her to him. Gardani, he didn't think much of it either, he asked her too, but seeing that she did nothing, he beat his fist on his chest and threatened that not even in a snake hole would he escape - and the girl's father and that boy. The very next day - he was in the mountains, with good friends after him.
Yeah... Love knows no bounds, it makes - but it also breaks, tears apart houses, turns everything upside down.
The girl's father was caught and cut down, and then Dinu: one night, when he was in the sheepfold with some shepherds, his kinsmen - Gardani came and slaughtered them all, as many as he found there.
After that, the iniquities did not stop. Gardani spread terror for years. Late, in the end, he calmed down; but as soon as something else happened, his name was again spoken by all.
And just as the branches, the leaves - they feel when the storm comes and start to tremble, to scream in fear, so do people whisper at each new horror: Gardani, it's him, he's near! Maybe it wasn't true, maybe he had fallen for it and come down from the mountains, who knows when - what do we know - but the world was blooming, of course, and more and more murders and robberies were being committed...
- I mean, was it two? - Lena asked.
- Two, yes... Negators. They came from abroad. They didn't even get to see each other at home with their kids and wives.
- And who killed them?
- Well, who, Gardani... Who else do you want to be?!
- I don't think... Gardani had his accounts, so don't mess it up randomly. Then he seems to be dead.
- God, you guys are stupid. He told you he died! No, no, no, no, no. They're the ones spreading these rumors!
- I mean, why?
- They must have sent a lot of gendarmes after them and - so as not to catch them... to loosen their pursuit...
- Maybe so.
The war echoes on and on and on and on, the hush, and the spata, all: tra-ca, tra-ca! Tegă's said she too, in thought:
- Who knows what kind of man he is!
- Gardani?
- Gardani.
- Well, how can it be... a man there! Not too tall, but handsome, of course - with a beard like tar. He's here now, then you meet him far away, I don't know where... What a miracle! Didn't our Todi meet him in a row?
- How so?
The war stopped at once. Only the flies buzzed around, while Sile's tucha - his tucha - told how it happened:
- There you go! He was coming back from the sheep... He ran into the outlaw all the way across the Plain of the Ravine.
- Must have been someone else!
- Well, no! It was Gardani himself - with his beard, his tresses...
- No way! Gardani doesn't show himself to anyone...
The Toli-john was silent, the grave. From time to time, he raised his bushy eyebrows, and his eyes seemed to awaken from some ugly, chaotic, deep dream. A'Tegă wondered aloud, watching him. She didn't understand what kind of man he was. She knew he was worthy, and that they had all taken him in fear; since they had been tochising him into their service - a goat had not lost them; but, strange being, anyway: not to laugh, at least to smile at him! Always gloomy... What's the matter with him? That's how he sometimes talked to Tegă, his husband. Once she asked the shepherd:
- Hey, Toli - you've been staying with us for months, and you didn't tell us: are you married too?
The man winces!
- No, I'm not, he said.
- But you weren't even there? Don't you have a wife, your own house...
- Home... Hm, sighed Toli. Yes, yes... I could have had my own family... I met a girl, but - what can you do? It wasn't to be, because I was poor...
He spoke stolidly, his eyes twinkling - and suddenly waving his hand in disgust, as if to say: "I have a lot on my mind," he added:
- What a thing!... That girl died... I'm going to die too, we're all going down, and the One above will judge us.
One Tuesday at noon, since Toli didn't go down to get his usual groceries, his Tegă decided to climb up the Aitoși. He saddled his horse, bought two sacks of bread, small loaves, took a freshly cut lamb, went to the mill where he had left some barley for the feed, and then - come, come, after the horse, the day was over, for by the time he reached his goats it was evening.
The shepherds couldn't believe they saw him with them when he reached the top. And Tegă's, he had not even unhitched his horse, and he was glad:
- You even brought a lamb to put on the spit!
- We'll eat it together, said Toli; stay with us tonight.
- I can't, they're waiting for me at home.
- Are you really going to come back?... Maybe you want to...
- Stay here with us," Panu, Toli's companion, swarmed in. At night, the roads are fraught with danger.
Tegă's was looking around, suspicious. And, his eyes fell on a rifle and a yak all the time, glinting on the ground next to Toli. By nature, he wasn't a coward, but - to see at night, just like that... that you're thinking of death somehow, whatever you say... He looked up at Toli. His chest, bare and beaten by the light, hairy and broad - it looked as if it had been cast from brass.
"Next to a man like that, thought his Tega, I have nothing to fear!"
They made them eat. Without a word, they unwrapped the lamb with their hands, and swallowed in silence. Toli had plucked a whole shoulder and now watched it, with rapt attention, in the flickering firelight. Tegă's said:
- What?
- Nothing... It's like blood, blood follows me, I see. Take a look, Panule, he urged his companion. And he held out his mug.
- Yeah, Panu mumbled... blood, yikes - like that, like a red eggplant.
A few more minutes go by, and suddenly the dogs are on to something, to break! From the way they barked - it was clear they sensed strange, mean people. Toli didn't lose his temper. He listened for a moment, to figure it out, then took the rifle from beside him and asked Tegă:
- Do you carry a gun?
- Yeah, a gun...
- All right, take it and get in the hut; don't you flinch from there. And you, Panule, get away from the fire, get in the shade.
That's all he had to say and - presto, the anger showed. They came in a blur, shunning the moonlight. Toli saw them and shouted at them, twice. Well, nothing! The shepherd unholstered his gun and fired into the air.
- Don't shoot, man, don't shoot!... - they shouted angrily.
And it's a mess! Swearing on both sides, goats bleating..., dogs barking like hell... And another fire, and another, - Toli's rifle thundered, and cries followed: "That'll clean us all, all of us!"
- Weapons down!" cries Toli.
- Ready! But - stop shooting!
- Put down your weapons!
Toli's voice thundered; you shuddered, just hearing it! The fugitives put down their rifles and approached. There were three of them, dressed in black, uncovered. A younger one, about thirty-five years old, with a silver chain on his chest, handsomely dressed, with a bright face, though thin and pale - you wouldn't have thought he was a thief, - if you met him in the village you would have called him an orc.
Now blood was dripping from one leg and curdling on his white boots. Toli leaned down beside him and wrinkled her brow in anger and pain.
The fur was silent. Toli folded his hands across his chest and shook his head:
- You found me to rob, you found me to steal, huh? You know you, you know who I was, - you know?... Then she looked at him, they both looked at each other, steadily, deep into each other's eyes, as if bewitched, as if they had enchanted each other. Toli was thinking, but so was the other: where did they meet? That they must have seen each other somewhere before... Slowly, slowly, a light came to them, from the past, and they seemed to glimpse something, they began to remember, like two travellers who had lost each other and after years saw each other and, coming closer and closer, they recognised each other, then they shook hands, embraced.
- Gardani!" said the stranger, dazzled! Is that you?
At that moment, Tegă's shuddered and felt tingling all down his spine. Who had shouted? Which Gardani, where was this Gardani? With an icy heart, after all that had happened, he went out of the hut and stood there like a fool: Toli and Furul were kissing each other on the mouth, brotherly, and talking to each other:
- Gardani, Gardani, Gardani, Gardani - I thought you were dead... so some people told me, that you were dead, my boy...
- No, bro," said Toli. It would have been better to die, of course... But, my brother - look, your wound hurts!... I've hurt you, you see, I was just short of killing you, I was still carrying a soul, I was still staining myself with more blood... but I was ready to kill you, my brother. Who pushed you right into my rifle? Just a little more and... If I killed you, if you died, my Manole-brother... Another soul, another blood burden...
Toli spoke obliquely, heavily. And for the first time - in years - his eyelashes were getting wet. He let go of Manole and, with a cloth, he dressed the wound. The others watched in the firelight, dumbfounded. The eyelashes, the forest - everything was asleep at that hour of the night.
In the morning, from the uncharted distance, from the deserts and the caves came all kinds of whispers, noises, tinkling, barely heard, unintelligible voices, as if the earth were breathing in its sleep, sighing heavily, it knows why.
Zise Manole:
- Remember, Gardani? We were wandering through the Baitani Mountains, we were at Piatra Furcii, remember?... we were together, when the posse came upon us, the pack! We held them off until evening, and when it got dark... hey, that's when I saw who Gardani was!... we were all cleaning up without you, brother. You leapt forward, and in that scuffle - when we slammed into the posse with swords, I heard you thundering and calling us after you! After that, when the mighty men came after us, firing their rifles and driving us mad with their trumpets - we lost track of you; so we scattered, and I was left alone in a valley somewhere, a little below the Stone of the Forks. Do you remember? I think it's about five years, six maybe. And since then, look - today I see you again! You've grown old, my friend Gardani, you've grown white. Where are the rest of us?
- The others... Whoever, I let them go... Brother Manole, what a hell I've fallen into, what sins I've committed and how they weigh me down now! And I wasn't bad, man, to harm anyone, no... I wouldn't have killed - God damn me if I lie. Only... who was I living for, who was I living for, if not for her, that good, dear, beautiful girl? Brother, I'd loved her a lot, and not for a year, not for two - but since I was a cripple. The whole village knew it - and the girl's father, and Dinu... If it hadn't been Dinu - I wouldn't be the one I am now, I wouldn't have become a Gardani, so that people would curse me! And how many times I told Dinu, and prayed to him - to leave the girl, not to drive me crazy; but he - no! Besides, Dinu had flocks of sheep, he was possessed, while I had nothing... and - they gave him his daughter... without asking her, because she didn't like him at all; but they gave her to him... and they got married. What could we do? Stick my fist in my mouth and shut up? No, I couldn't, because Dinu wouldn't get out of my head, the blood was burning in my veins - as if I had a jar running through my whole being, not anything else, and I felt like my arms were slapping from so much tension, and I wanted to punch, to kick, to kill... And later, it came over me, like a rage - and I didn't spare them anymore, I cut them both, Dinu and the girl's father, I broke them, I killed them.
Gardani fell silent. Then he said again, as if to himself:
- The girl was wasting away in a few years; she died of a bad heart. They buried her... We'll die sometime, anyway, who knows where we'll rot, and who'll mourn us? - Maybe some people will be glad we're dead... The way we've been behaving will be... Manole, since she left, I've had a wound in my heart and I'm melting...
I wanted to surrender, or to unload my rifle into my chest... I wandered all over the place, and one day I came across Tegă's, - God keep him; I said I was from Blața, a shepherd... What would they know...
But you, my brother, what wind has carried you here?
- You're a real fart, my Gardani. I've been locked up in the Threshing-floor for three years - three centuries, it seems! Prison ate my soul. For months I dug, I dug with my hands, with my claws, until - one cursed night, while it was pouring rain, I broke through the walls of the dungeon and escaped, with these two friends of mine. And as I saw myself in the mountains again, I thought of you. Then I learned that you had perished, but - look how it was destined, to find you alive and falling under your rifle bullets, brother Gardani... and it's not a month since I escaped.
The blackness of the night was slowly, slowly fading away. The Furies held their tongue, seemingly frightened by the daylight, they fell silent, heads down - dazed by the flood of dawn that bloomed on the horizon.
Gardani's Toli asked the three furi:
- Where to now, guys?
- Well, what do we know? We'll swarm... For only the forest is endless.
WITH CHERVANGIII
- Well, yeah... Tomorrow, God willing, we're in the village; tonight, though, man makes mas here.
- Very well!... - we all said, in one voice.
We sat down on the ground, and the horses were turned loose to graze. Beautiful places! And what a clear night! In the open field, deep in sleep, fresh scents mingled with fireflies - candles hidden in the grass. Never was I so longed for life!
What a life these chervangis lead! So much so that, after a while, they've had enough trouble. But just think what it was like when the caravans used to go around without stopping and come home with bags full of pennies!...
Next to our resting place was a puddle, over which a kind of invisible shroud had been laid. Now and then, someone seemed to lift the sail from the face of the water, to kiss and unkiss it. And the water would slowly shiver, in barely foaming ripples, whispering strange things to each other, running, running...
The sky, the moon, the stars shining far, far away, the weeping willows, all could be seen as if - tipped somewhere towards the bottom of the puddle that mirrored them.
Eh, what wonders!... A fairytale world down there!
Always, the puddles, the sea have always amazed me with their unsearchable mysteries.
The Chervangis tell stories of the dragon, the fairies - who cook themselves like our girls and then go out to the spring, when...
- Shh! Shut up - whispers an old man with white hair, dressed in an equally white sarong.
- What is it?
- Did you clog the horses' traps? - asked the old man thoughtfully.
- Stuck! But why?
- Oh, my God. The old man bows hastily and shakes his head. Praise be to your name!
- What is it, Uncle?
- Well, don't you know where we are? Haven't you heard of these places?... Ouch, ouch, ouch! And he pricked up his ears while we waited...
In the silent, still night - muffled voices, like bells, seemed to come out of a pool. We were terrified!
- Where do the voices come from? Do they come from the deep?
- No, there's nothing left!... - said the old man.
But again that echo rose and came towards us - this time as if the drums were being beaten.
- Listen up!... Great is his power. God leaves nothing unpunished. Here, where the pond is," the old man began, "there were once all kinds of buildings, and a great market was built, with a furnace of mankind. A priest, who lived here - cursed be he - fell in love with his daughter.
- De fie-sa?!
- Yeah, yeah... He'd been thinking badly of his daughter. And the poor girl, day and night, worshipped the icons of the Virgin Mary to get rid of her. And on a feast day, when people were gathered at church and the girl was praying there, this priest, her father, came upon her to torment her. At that moment, the church and the whole village collapsed, and water flooded over the houses. The priest and the girl were transformed into two fishes - who still run and run and run and never catch up...
The old man fell silent just as the pool roared once more.
- They run, they run, and they never catch up!... - we thought, involuntarily, overcome by an incomprehensible fear.
- And the church and the steeples remain - to beat the drums, to ring alone in the silent nights.
...I leaned over the edge of the puddle once more. The moon, as big as a cartwheel, was sinking deep into the water, and so were the red stars, as if lit, and the clouds - in trills... And I thought I saw some churches with their gates shut... While the bell towers were ringing without restraint...
OLD PEOPLE
Eh, you - people of yesteryear!
What a lot of householders' houses were built here, and what people owned them!
...Back then, these houses were protected by a fence, and when you looked at them - they shone clean and ornate, like mansions.
From dawn to dusk - the children were running around, laughing and being all good-natured, because these were the homes of a large family.
I remember well...
It was in a spring. Trees were blooming in the gardens and white butterflies were dancing among the flowers.
One day, early in the morning, a young man stopped here with a little lamb in his arms. He looked up at the high windows and began to sing:
What a herd I have, proud one!
Ian looks up at the plain;
You'll see my lambs frolicking -
How many stars are in the sky!
I've got little lambs eye,
I've got whites - like snow -
That my breasts were calving,
And it always increases my flock.
And I choose to give it to you,
Of lambs - the dearest!
That's what this young shepherd called him.
But why didn't anyone answer? As used to happen when he came back from wintering and was greeted by a cod woman - who opened the window and answered his song with a kind word...
- Welcome home, shepherd boy!
- Welcome back, my pride and joy!
- So how was the wintering, you shepherd boy?
- The Lord has given that we have done well with the flocks; but I missed you so much...
- Long live the shepherd boy! And sing like that, and blow your whistle - because all winter I haven't heard any singing...
And the shepherd sang, and always joyfully returned to his flock, where the sheep were waiting for him with love, roaming the pastures.
And today he brought the girl a lamb, out of his great love for her. But what about her? The boy couldn't understand what was happening... Why didn't she come to the window again, like a full moon, and wish him - in her honeyed voice: "Welcome, my shepherd boy"?
He sings to them again:
Put away the pitchfork
And look up on the plain;
I have sheep - countless,
And I wear them, as in a retinue...
Nothing was coming out of the house. Silence, heavy. The shepherd then asked:
- Where are these guys going?
Someone answers him:
- They melted too, who knows where!
It's been years... And, after all this time, here I am again in front of the same houses. The fence was now broken down, cattle were grazing in the yard.
I would have liked to hear laughter again, children's voices playing...
But, I'm met with nothing but desolation!
What a proud ass this was, and what people owned it! It's as if they weren't.
I look up. The eaves are about to fall. Only green ivy climbs to the roof, as if trying to cover the ruin's mournful, crumbling walls.
What a mess! I wish I'd known what happened to the people here, where they disappeared to, without a trace.
Next door, an old woman was resting on the threshold next to the gate, twirling her fork. It was as if she was twisting the fork of her life.
I was approaching her. She looked at me.
- Where are these Christians?
The old woman looks at me again and sighs deeply...
- Hey, my fetus! Well, there they go, and they never come back!
- But a shepherd boy who's always running around - don't you know, mother, what's wrong with him? A handsome one, with a floppy hair...
- "A handsome shepherd, with his hair in the wind..." Grandma was a bit confused. Oh, yes, yes, I know... I'm old now, but I still remember. My grandmother once said to me: "Look, mother, what's with this shepherd. What about him? He's always hanging around, and I feel so sorry for him! His face is proud, but look how pale he is, and it's as if he's in tears"... And I sought the lad out for a word. He was sitting on the rock: "Son," I said, "what business have you here?" He was crying. I don't know why he was crying. But he asked me: "These people who stayed here, aren't they coming back?" "As you can see, my boy, they're not going to..." I haven't seen that shepherd since.
After a year the shepherds asked about him and then told what they found out, that is, that no one had seen him wintering that winter. He had left his sheep in the care of a friend to graze them, a friend from whom he would have had a hard time parting. God knows, son, I don't know... But then one night, someone played, from the whistle, as I've never heard so sad!...
Grandma paused for a moment and shook her head in wonder.
And there was a storm, and the wind was howling... And all night long a whistle cried around this house. I don't know, but I think it was him, that shepherd... That only he could play so sadly... Well, no, that kind of singing wasn't a good sign. Yes, my son, it couldn't be a good sign, such singing...
THE WOLF AND THE FOX
It was - what wasn't.
Once there was a wolf, - Cumatran-Nicola, and a fox, - Cumatran-Mara.
These two came together to hunt together, and the game, they said to each other, they would share it brotherly.
Going out hunting, but I come across a pot of honey.
- Aha!," rushed Cumătru-Nicola, "a pap!
- First and foremost you don't have to say "o pap!", but "o păpăm", said Cumătra-Mara. Then, don't even think about it, I didn't even hit the pot, and that's it: go for it! If you want to make a home together, know that we don't do it by swallowing every penny...
- Be it, Mara, as you know.
- Yes, as I know! Let's do like everyone else. Now, for example, we hide the honey and every three days we go and eat it.
They did as the sly Cumahtra-Mara said: they hid the honey under a juniper tree.
Not a day goes by and behold, the fox bitch tells the wolf:
- Master Nicola, someone's calling me to baptize them!
- If he calls you, go!" said the wolf.
The fox went over and - lip-lip! - swallowed the honey from above, because that's where it came from, that was its baptism.
On the way back the wolf asked her:
- What name did you give the baby, Mother-in-law?
- The beginning! What else would I call the first boy in the man's house?
- Nice name! Long live you! - the wolf cried.
The next day the fox - again:
- Cumetre-Nicola, calling me to baptize again.
- Well, go, if he calls you!
Off goes the fox and - lip-lip!, he halved the honey pot.
When she came back, the wolf asked her again:
- What name did you give him, Howdy Doody?
- I called him Halfling, because he was a girl this time.
Another day passes, and the fox:
- Master Nicola, and today he calls me to baptize!
Wolf-wolf, how can he understand that this isn't clean? "Go!". So he said.
Now the fox has cooked all the honey in the pot!
Returning from there, Cumătru-Nicola asks again, curious:
- Well, what did you call the new baby?
- The fox, who knew that he had put all the honey in the right place, said.
- Nice name, - long live you, hates the silly wolf.
The three days had just passed, and now he had to go and taste the honey. But what else was there to taste? Stones? Because the fox had eaten all the honey.
- Cumetre-Nicola, Cumetre-Nicola, - you've been grazing the honey yourself, as I see it, said the fox.
- Forgive me, Countess Face," said the wolf, "but it seems to me that you have made this wonderful little chore!
He, that you, she, that you - they fought and broke up.
The fox started towards the village to catch a hen. On the way she meets a priest. The shepherd was walking home from the church with his donkey loaded with springs. She saw him from a distance and lay down by the path, pretending to be dead. The priest, seeing her, took her by the leg and threw her on the donkey on top of the spices. "She's good," said the man to himself, "a fur for my priestess!"
The fox, in the back, unties the sacks and throws the prescriptions one by one, all of them, into the road. Then she gets down and again - one by one - picks them all up and - that's your way! She arrives with the spices in the forest. Here is Jupân-Nicola. He asks in astonishment:
- Where did you come from, Mara?
- Where would it come from, Cumetre-Nicola? Well, from the church!
- But how did they give them to you? How did you do it?
- How did you do it? How was I supposed to do it? I went to the door of the church and started to chop the priest: give me, my fathers, a sprinkle! - give me, my fathers, a sprinkle! What could the priest do? He gave me a whole bag instead of a spice!
- Then I'll go too. Can I have one?
- Of course not! How could you not?!
The wolf wastes no time, and there he is - at church. He sticks his head through the door and starts howling - wolf, what a thing!
- Give me, Father, a prescription! Give me a prescription, Father!
- Huooo, lupe! Whoo, wolf! - everyone starts shouting - the wolf didn't know how to make himself invisible from there.
So, he was back in the forest. The fox came out before him and asked him how he was doing. The wolf told him what had happened to him and how they would scare him if they got him.
- But tell me, how did you ask, the fox asked.
- Well, there you go: Give me, Father, a prescription!
- Well, that's why he didn't give it to you, Cumetre-Nicola. You have to ask in a lower voice, not like that - screaming! Softly, softly, that's the way to ask: "Give me, my fathers, a prescription".
The fool of a wolf, who had once escaped with his life, let himself be led by the fox's nose, and went once more, to ask now... in a lower voice. Only, poor Cumberland didn't even get his head through the door, and the world: "Hooo, on him!" with dogs, with dogs, and burn him, and burn him with their hair, till they kill him!
And with that, the fox got rid of the mischievous wolf.
THE THREE SLOTHS
It was - what I never mentioned!
There were once three lazy men, Mitu, Pitu and Chitu - like you wouldn't believe. Lazy as they were, they ate once every three days.
They leave, go to a village. But lest any should tire a step more - they grasped each other behind the shoulders, and when one lifted his leg, to stretch it further, the others moved!
All the way - they didn't say a word out of their mouths, not a word of cure; if you had seen them, you would have said they were dumb. Suddenly, one of them spots a lyre in their path. And, not to say many words, he just said, "There it is!" That was Mitu. "Who...?", said Pitu; "let them take it...", added Chitu; "you bastards!", ended Mitu.
Well, sure - coughs, otherwise how can only one bend?
The three of them grab the lyre, in a big hurry, after taking about an hour to bend down and then stand up again. And, out of laziness, so that only one of them would not hold the yellow one, they all held it with one finger each!
Yavash-yavas, yavash-yavas reached the village they had left for and pulled up at an inn. The innkeeper - to faint with laughter, when he saw the state they were in. But, seeing the lyre in their hands, he did not mock them, but received them kindly and asked them what they wanted.
- Pie, meat, wine, yogurt - they said.
The devil, the innkeeper, didn't stay around much; he heard what they wanted, he made them a pie, he cooked their meat, he filled them a cup of wine and brought them a plate of yogurt. He set the table for them, filled their yolks, and left them in the Lord's payment.
All good, but who's gonna cut the pie now? I'm sitting with my hands against the wall and closing my eyes... Whoever moves it first, or talks - that's who'll cut it. But, you've found who'll talk or move! They sit like icons on the walls in the church.
A beggar, one of those who go around people's doors, also passes by their door at the inn, pokes his head into the room and begins to pray:
- Make yourselves alms, people...
But when he saw that they weren't moving at all, he kept getting closer, slowly, slowly. And as he came closer, closer, the smell of the pie sprang to his nostrils, and the man wasted no time, and laid it down before him - and give it to him, and burn it - first the top sheet, then the nettles with eggs, cheese and milk in it, then the edges, and the bottom sheet - nothing left, not a crumb.
Only when he finishes eating the pie, he starts to eat the meat, you'd think he was starving - he'd just come out of fasting, so hungry was he and he was hungry!
After he had put the meat on well, he had an appetite for wine. But the beggar lifted up the cup, and - gobble-gobble, gobble-gobble - until there was not a drop left. Once this little cup was done, the man was drunk, for it had gone to his head. Here he is, talking to himself - who is he, there's no one like him! At last he took hold and plastered the lazy man's mouths with yoghurt, then he gathered up what was left of the dishes, and washed the pot!
As he leaves, a dog enters the room and goes after the leftovers from the feast. When he sees that no one chases him away, he approaches the three lazy ones and starts licking them; he licks one, moves on to the other, and when he gets to the third one, he doesn't know what to do or what to do, because he bites him on the ear, and he bites this one to his knees.
He couldn't take it anymore and howled:
- Ow, woe is me!
As soon as they heard him "woe is me!" - the other two, in one voice, cried out:
- Cut the pie, because you talked!
What a pie to cut, the Lord would cut them out of heaven - there was no cure left.
And that's what happened to those lazy, lazy bastards.
QUICK-WITTED GIRL
It is said that once upon a time - and it's a long time since then - there lived an emperor who was an Abraham and a pagan. For who knows what, he punished the poor people terribly. So, woe to those who fell into his hands!
No one escaped his malice, a proud and beautiful man like an angel, who - who knows what he had done, that the emperor had thrown him in prison and ordered that nothing be given him to eat, to leave him there to die of hunger. No one, friend or foe, was allowed to go and see him. Only the daughter of the imprisoned man, a widow with an infant child, was allowed to visit him twice a day. But even she was thoroughly searched before going to her father's house - lest she hide something to eat. It broke the poor girl's heart with pity to see that her poor father was growing weaker day by day, and after four days, when she went to him and saw him faint with hunger, she felt so sorry for him that she gave him suck at her breast. From then on she weaned her babe, and twice a day she bent over her father, as to a babe, to feed him.
In this way, she was able to save him from death and, after a long struggle, she found a way to save him from prison. The girl knew that the emperor went out every day to ride on a horse that ran like a smeu in a fairy tale.
Thinking of what she had in her head, the girl pretended to be stupid and, at the palace gate, when she went out and when the emperor came in, she said this song:
Emperor handsome,
Squeeze your runaway horse,
That too flies like the wind,
If you don't understand my word.
Your horse is not born,
But his mum still helps him.
From the prison wilderness,
Get out, ladies, back in the sun
The man I feed at my breast
And he's the master of his mother.
A few days went by like that. The emperor kept hearing the song - both when he left and when he came back, but he thought the girl was stupid, and didn't take any notice of her words.
One day, the girl sang with so much lament, that the king stopped his horse to hear better the words that, now, no longer seemed to be those of a fool. He called her to his side and asked her what she meant: "horse that is not born, but still his mother helps him" and "man that I feed at his breast, and is his mother's master". The girl said that the horse he was riding was not foaled by the mare, but was taken from her womb, for she could not foal him, so he was born as a colt, and the mare's skin was made into a saddle, which was put on the horse. So she knew from her aunt. Then she told the king that she knew of a man who, as he had commanded, had been thrown into prison and left there hungry; this man is her father, and so that he might not starve, she feeds him as a baby at her breast.
When the king heard this, and saw how wise she was and how much love she had for her father, his heart was so softened that he immediately released the prisoner from prison, and gave the girl a bag of coins.
